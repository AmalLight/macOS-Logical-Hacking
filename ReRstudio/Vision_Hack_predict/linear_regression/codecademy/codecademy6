A: close to 0 intercept_coefficient make result around to 0
B: The intercept coefficient is negative
C: The intercept coefficient make that we will expect result from 0.90 and 1.25
D: close to 0 intercept_coefficient make result around to 0
```{r}
intercept_coefficient <- 'c'
# uncomment f-string below
#sprintf("Based on a simple regression of `total_convert` by `clicks`, we estimate that for every additional click, the number of product purchases increases by %s.", clicks_coefficient)
