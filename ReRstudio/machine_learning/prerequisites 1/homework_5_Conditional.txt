| If you were given a fair die and asked what the probability of rolling a 3
| is, what would you reply?
1: 1/3
2: 1/6
3: 1
4: 1/4
5: 1/2

| Suppose the person who gave you the dice rolled it behind your back and told
| you the roll was odd. Now what is the probability that the roll was a 3?
1: 1/6
2: 1/3
3: 1/4
4: 1/2
5: 1

| Back to our dice example. Which of the following expressions represents
| P(A&B), where A is the event of rolling a 3 and B is the event of the roll
| being odd?
1: 1/4
2: 1/2
3: 1
4: 1/3
5: 1/6

3/6 * 1/3 = 1/6

| Continuing with the same dice example. Which of the following expressions
| represents P(A&B)/P(B), where A is the event of rolling a 3 and B is the
| event of the roll being odd?
1: (1/2)/(1/6)
2: 1/6
3: (1/3)/(1/2)
4: (1/6)/(1/2)

P(A&B)/P(B)==B->A

| Let 'D' be the event that the patient has HIV, and let '+' indicate a
| positive test result and '-' a negative. What information do we know? Recall
| that we know the accuracy rates of the HIV test.
1: P(+|D) and P(-|~D)
2: P(+|~D) and P(-|~D)
3: P(+|D) and P(-|D)
4: P(+|~D) and P(-|D)

| Suppose a person gets a positive test result and comes from a population with
| a HIV prevalence rate of .001. We'd like to know the probability that he
| really has HIV. Which of the following represents this?
1: P(~D|+)
2: P(+|D)
3: P(D|-)
4: P(D|+)
positivo se viene riscontrata l'infezione da Hiv.
L'esito è negativo se non viene riscontrata l'infezione da Hiv.
P( +|D )
P( D|+ ) # possibilità di avere l'hiv dopo un test positivo

| Disease prevalence is .001. Test sensitivity (+ result with disease) is 99.7%
| and specificity (- result without disease) is 98.5%. First compute the
| numerator, P(+|D)*P(D). (This is also part of the denominator.)
P(~D)=0.999
 P(D)=0.001
P(+|D)=0.997
P(-|~D)=0.985
P(+|~D)=1-0.985 = 0.015
P(D|+)= ( 0.997 * 0.001 ) / ( 0.997 * 0.001 + 0.015 * 0.999 )

| The diagnostic likelihood ratio of a positive test, DLR_+, is the ratio of
| the two + conditional probabilities, one given the presence of disease and
| the other given the absence. Specifically, DLR_+ = P(+|D) / P(+|~D).
| Similarly, the DLR_- is defined as a ratio. Which of the following do you
| think represents the DLR_-?
1: P(-|D) / P(+|~D)
2: P(-|D) / P(-|~D)
3: P(+|~D) / P(-|D)
4: I haven't a clue.
DLR_+ = P(+|D) / P(+|~D)

| Since the numerator is close to 1 and the denominator is close to 0 do you
| expect DLR_+ to be large or small?
1: Small
2: I haven't a clue.
3: Large
3

| Now recall that DLR_- = P(-|D) / P(-|~D). Here the numerator is the
| complement of sensitivity and the denominator is specificity. From the
| arithmetic and what you know about accuracy tests, do you expect DLR_- to be
| large or small?
1: Large
2: I haven't a clue.
3: Small

| The left side of the equation represents the post-test odds of disease given
| a positive test result. The equation says that the post-test odds of disease
| equals the pre-test odds of disease (that is, P(D)/P(~D) ) times
1: I haven't a clue.
2: the DLR_+
3: the DLR_-
P(D|+) / P(~D|+)
2

| The equation P(D|-) / P(~D|-) = P(-|D) / P(-|~D) * P(D)/P(~D) says what about
| the post-test odds of disease relative to the pre-test odds of disease given
| negative test results?
1: post-test odds are less than pre-test odds
2: post-test odds are greater than pre-test odds
3: I haven't a clue.

| We've seen examples of independence in our previous probability lessons.
| Let's review a little. What's the probability of rolling a '6' twice in a row
| using a fair die?
1: 1/6
2: 1/2
3: 1/36
4: 2/6

| You're given a fair die and asked to roll it twice. What's the probability
| that the second roll of the die matches the first?

| If the chance of developing a disease with a genetic or environmental
