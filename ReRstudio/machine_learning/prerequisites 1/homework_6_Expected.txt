Another term for expected value is mean. average| Consider the random variable X representing a roll of a fair dice. By 'fair'
| we mean all the sides are equally likely to appear. What is the expected
| value of X?

| To find the expected value of this random variable you need to integrate the
| function t*f(t). Here f(t)=t/2, the diagonal line. (You might recall this
| from the last probability lesson.) The function you're integrating over is
| therefore t^2/2. We've defined a function myfunc for you representing this.
| You can use the R function 'integrate' with parameters myfunc, 0 (the lower
| bound), and 2 (the upper bound) to find the expected value. Do this now.

| Each of these 10 samples will have a mean, right? We can use the R function
| apply to calculate the mean of each row of the matrix allsam. We simply call
| apply with the arguments allsam, 1, and mean. The second argument, 1, tells
| 'apply' to apply the third argument 'mean' to the rows of the matrix. Try
| this now.
