"2","Stuning even for the nongamerThis sound track was beautiful It paints the senery in your mind so well I would recomend it even to people who hate vid game music I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras It would impress anyone who cares to listen"
"2","The best soundtrack ever to anythingIm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best game soundtrack and I figured that Id write a review to disagree a bit This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsudas ultimate masterpiece The music is timeless and Im been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fadeThe price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny"
"2","AmazingThis soundtrack is my favorite music of all time hands down The intense sadness of Prisoners of Fate which means all the more if youve played the game and the hope in A Distant Promise and Girl who Stole the Star have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years The higher energy tracks like Chrono Cross Times Scar Time of the Dreamwatch and Chronomantique indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger are all absolutely superb as wellThis soundtrack is amazing music probably the best of this composers work I havent heard the Xenogears soundtrack so I cant say for sure and even if youve never played the game it would be worth twice the price to buy itI wish I could give it 6 stars"
"2","Excellent SoundtrackI truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and its truly relaxing and peacefulOn disk one my favorites are Scars Of Time Between Life and Death Forest Of Illusion Fortress of Ancient Dragons Lost Fragment and Drowned ValleyDisk Two The Draggons Galdorb Home Chronomantique Prisoners of Fate Gale and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three The best of the three Garden Of God Chronopolis Fates Jellyfish sea Burning Orphange Dragons Prayer Tower Of Stars Dragon God and Radical Dreamers Unstealable JewelOverall this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game musicXander Cross"
"2","Remember Pull Your Jaw Off The Floor After Hearing itIf youve played the game you know how divine the music is Every single song tells a story of the game its that good The greatest songs are without a doubt Chrono Cross Times Scar Magical Dreamers The Wind The Stars and the Sea and Radical Dreamers Unstolen Jewel Translation varies This music is perfect if you ask me the best it can be Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper"
"2","an absolute masterpieceI am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once and heard at least a few of the tracks here And whether you were aware of it or not Mitsudas music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole gameComposed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs I havent an exact count all of which are heartrendering and impressively remarkable this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget It has everything for every listener from fastpaced and energetic Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home to slower and more haunting Dragon God to purely beautifully composed Times Scar to even some fantastic vocals Radical DreamersThis is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there and surely Mitsudas best ever"
"1","Buyer bewareThis is a selfpublished book and if you want to know whyread a few paragraphs Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms Haddons family and friendsor perhaps by herself I cant imagine anyone reading the whole thingI spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a worst book contest I cant believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on To Kill a Mockingbirda book I am quite sure Ms Haddon never heard of Anyway unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a jokestay far far away from this one"
"2","Glorious storyI loved Whisper of the wicked saints The story was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the book I am not normaly someone who is into romance novels but the world was raving about this book and so I bought it I loved it This is a brilliant story because it is so true This book was so wonderful that I have told all of my friends to read it It is not a typical romance it is so much more Not reading this book is a crime becuase you are missing out on a heart warming story"
"2","A FIVE STAR BOOKI just finished reading Whisper of the Wicked saints I fell in love with the caracters I expected an average romance read but instead I found one of my favorite books of all time Just when I thought I could predict the outcome I was shocked The writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when Julias did and I felt as if I was there with them instead of just a distant reader If you are a lover of romance novels then this is a must read Dont let the cover fool you this book is spectacular"
"2","Whispers of the Wicked SaintsThis was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on not easy to put downIt left me wanting to read the follow on which I hope is coming soon I used to read a lot but have gotten away from it This book made me want to read again Very enjoyable"
"1","The WorstA complete waste of time Typographical errors poor grammar and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing Im embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book"
"2","Great bookThis was a great bookI just could not put it downand could not read it fast enough Boy what a book the twist and turns in this just keeps you guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next This book makes you fall in love and can heat you upit can also make you so angery this book can make you go throu several of your emotions This is a quick read romance It is something that you will want to end your day off with if you read at night"
"2","Great ReadI thought this book was brilliant but yet realistic It showed me that to error is human I loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of God and not the revengeful side of him I loved how it twisted and turned and I could not put it down I also loved The glass castle"
"1","Oh pleaseI guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one and not a very discerning one All others beware It is absolute drivel I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover but the first page of the book removed all doubt Wait maybe Im missing the point A quick reread of the beginning now makes it clear This has to be an intentional churning of overheated prose for satiric purposes Phew so glad I didnt waste 1095 after all"
"1","Awful beyond beliefI feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age As another reviewer points out there is a misspelling on the cover and I believe there is at least one per chapter For example it was mentioned twice that she had a lean on her house I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling Please dont waste your money I too believe that the good reviews must have been written by the authors relatives I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on"
"1","Dont try to fool us with fake reviewsIts glaringly obvious that all of the glowing reviews have been written by the same person perhaps the author herself They all have the same misspellings and poor sentence structure that is featured in the book Who made Veronica Haddon think she is an author"
"2","A romantic zen baseball comedyWhen you hear folks say that they dont make em like that anymore they might be talking about BY THE SEA This is a very cool story about a young Cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man three hysterical Italian chefs and a Latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resorts owner As is often the case she finds herself through honest often comical but always emotional interaction with this sizzling roster of players With the perfect mix of special effects that salsa sound and flashbacks BY THE SEA gets 4 BIG stars from me"
"2","Fashionable Compression StockingsAfter I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings Then I found Jobst UltraSheer They gave me the compression I needed 1520 but looked like regular pantyhose Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so niceNote I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh I tried the Jobst adhesive but I hated having my skin pulled all day I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling"
"2","Jobst UltraSheer Thigh HighExcellent product However they are very difficult to get on for older people I feel like Ive had a full day workout after getting them on Also as the day wears on they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin I have to wear them so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help"
"1","sizes recomended in the size chart are not realsizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart I tried to put it and sheer it I guess you should not buy this item in the internetit is better to go to the store and check it"
"1","mens ultrasheerThis model may be ok for sedentary types but Im active and get around alot in my job consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles Not Good Solution go with the standard compression stocking 2030 stock 114622 Excellent support stays up and gives me what I need Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time Good riddancebad investment"
"2","Delicious cookie mixI thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies But no it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the titleThis is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy it is extremely sticky However with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy Also this mix has really large chocolate chips in itI love thatI removed a star for the addition of natural flavors in the mix"
"1","Another Abysmal Digital CopyRather than scratches and insect droppings this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealerIf youve ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white The surrounding countryside and old home scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright clear and immediateHere everything is dull dark and clouded Or if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captains commands so are the visualsAfter that it is hard to believe this award winning critically acclaimed films best presentation is on YOUTUBE Somewhere out there is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reelJust none of them appear to be on Amazon"
"2","A fascinating insight into the life of modern Japanese teensI thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters I dont know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents ageold Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community and their peers adulation of Western culture True to form the New Young of Japan seem to be creating an international blend as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out A great read"
"2","i liked this album more then i thought i wouldI heard a song or two and thought same o same obut when i listened to songs like blue angellanna and mama the hair just rose off my neckRoy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you dont find much now days"
"1","Problem with charging smaller AAAsI have had the charger for more than two years It charges AA batteries just fine but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up and now three out of the four wont hold The problem is the flip mechanism became loose and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon apply the crayon on the buttons and wrap the tape around You know how painful that is"
"1","Works but not as advertisedI bought one of these chargersthe instructions say the lights stay on while the battery chargestrue The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done Which is also true 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on I returned it thinking I had a bad unitThe new one did the same thing I just kept it since it does chargebut the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on Its a backup charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldnt want this as my only charger"
"1","DisappointedI read the reviewsmade my purchase and was very disappointed The charger is convenient by charging all four batteries at once but the charge only lasts a very short time I now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak NiMH AA batteries"
"1","Oh dearI was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism but this volume did not live up to the expectationsOne essay among other things describes the veil as potentially liberating It doesnt begin to explain how or whyAnother on Muslim women in Cape Town claims that Muslim women there are separate but more than equal Gee whiz what a disappointmentI had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid But there is not a single one in the bookIm surprised it didnt have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilationAlyssa A Lappen"
"2","Based on the reviews here I bought one and Im glad I didThis VCRDVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVDland but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet Based on the reviews and price and because I own a JVC TV this was my choice I agree with the easy setup Its a bit awkward to work the whole TVVHSDVD selection options but I think Ive gotten the hang of itTwo comments its not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technicallyminded than me so Ive had to rely heavily on the howto manual And setting the VCR timer is awkward you cant enter the start and end time but have to scroll unless Im missing somethingbut those are my only complaints This is a good product for your"
"1","Incorrect discI am a big JVC fan but I do not like this model I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store I bought one anyway new and must say I am not happy The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while the transition between scenes is not always smoothlike a little pause and while it is still fairly new I cant get any DVDCD or even a DVD headcleaner to work All I get is a incorrect disc message"
"2","happy with itbutIm a JVC nutI have 3 JVC televisions one VCR one bookshelf audio system and car audio system So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be I decided on the combo player because I dont think VHS is going to be around much longer I like my combo player except for 2 things1no cable box compatability on the remote control 2no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in monowife cant tell the difference in the sound so if shes happy then Ill just live with it VCR and DVD look and sound GREAT"
"1","should be titled Hollywood DebacleThe plot is so ridiculous I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer and the cars behind dont notice The mountain lion is captured and put in a jail cell Get real Utterly completely stupid"
"2","Is this great TV You bet it isHotel Babylon is not just good TVits great TV The show features some incredible acting from Tamzin Outhwaite formerly of EastEnders a BBC soap and Max Beesley from the illfated movie Glitter starring Mariah Carey The show could make for a great drama series but I felt that it is a mix of a drama comedy and soap opera all mixed into a great BBC show The show aired on BBC America for a while but didnt get around to seeing it I can now say that I got the DVD set and all the episodes are great The season finale was an interesting to watchThe show reminds me of Hotel which aired on ABC from 1983 to 1988 The reasonHotel was set at a fictional San Francisco hotel as Hotel Babylon was set at a luxury fivestar hotel in EnglandI recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to watch a great show from the BBC"
"1","Nothing you dont already knowIf you have even casually looked into applying to law school have already read everything there is in this book do not waste your money seriously"
"1","Unfortunately it wasnt entertaining in the least bitWhen I first ordered the CD I figured it was going to be a hip cool daddy vibe CD However much to my dismay it sounds like a fourth grade music class The main jist of the CD is that there is a xylaphone playing over peoples voices trying to replicate happening party I believe if I played this CD at a party anywhere in my neighborhood I would get laughed off the beach Growing up a surfer in San Diego I would not recommend this CD to any of my Southern California brothers Honestly when I played it I kinda of felt I was in a bad B movie The absolutle epitimy of the CD is the last vibe Surf Cha Cha Surfers dont CHA"
"2","Rochelle explains It All for YouWondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture This book is a lucid well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored and even mocked our personal and public responsibilities The final response and indictment of Robert Ringers best seller LOOKING OUT FOR 1 This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media politics and discourse in general to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans but as human beings A great book"
"2","More great playingLarrys work for the Muse label in the late 80s and early 90s found him exploring the rich catalog of jazz standards that he probably grew up playing Surrounding himself with the best musicians around Larry sounds relaxed focused and totally in control Listen to Larrys take on My Funny Valentine and tell me it doesnt stand right up there with Chet Bakers or Miles A very fine album that youll enjoy again and again"
"1","Doesnt work on a MacIt clearly says on line this will work on a Mac OS system The disk comes and it does not only Windows Do Not order this if you have a Mac"
"1","Very FrustratingMy three year old son was very excited to get this but after two attempts at playing it hasnt been touched since You are not able to use the mouse through any of the games except for the powerup segments instead you are using the updown arrows on the keyboard too hard for him and not much fun Very disapointed with this game and wish I could return it"
"1","Mind numbingThis game makes you do the same things over and over it never holds my sons attention long enough to get to the next level There is no choice of games you have to do every thing in order We have another Rescue Heroes game and both my boys 3 and 6 love it but this one is a dog"
"1","Cannot recommendAs a former Alaskan I didnt want to have to do this But after repeatedly attempting Allmans recipes and having to throw out 810 cups of flour and miscellaneous ingredients nearly every timeand then comparing to Ed Woods recipes which work flawlessly and Lisa Rayners very excellent Wild Bread Handbaked sourdough artisan breads in your own kitchen I cant help but notice that their recipes work where Allmans failIm not a novice baker The only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe but that can be found other places as wellIf you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it I recommend any of Ed Woods books even his very old ones Lisa Rayner has written a fabulous tome in Wild Bread But pass on this bookWhile some of the historical vignettes were interestingnot enough so to warrant the cost of the book Check it out at your library if you must"
"2","Alaska sourdoughREad most of the book while visiting my brother in Alaska Loved it I am going to be making my sourdough starter soon Book is full of great stories and recipes"
"2","Old and goodThis book is worth to keep in your collection as it does not only advise what to do with sourdough but Ruth also told you what the picture of past 100 years ago in Alaska where no stand mixer nor any civilized stuffs in kitchen just a pot of sourdough"
"2","autumngot this for my daughter in NC she is now making prefect bread Wish she lived closer to make me some"
"2","Fast mp3 download of music waxed decades agoOne of these 26 songs played as background music on a YouTube video of some kind of gymnastic or dance feat out of Russia I hunted down the melody read the English lyrics then decided to see what else was in the album Downloaded the full album for 15 via Amazon mp3 downloader and now happily listen to the melodies interspersed on my iPod"
"1","Maybe I got a bad oneMy experience I got this from FM not Amazon The DVD player rattled pretty loudly sometimes but not always when I put in a DVD I tried several The picture quality wasnt all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote the layout makes no sense at all Very poor human engineering IMO I brought it back to the store for a refund I saw the same model under the Emerson name for 400 at WM but was hesitant to buy it"
"2","Sylvania 6620LDG 20 Flat Panel LCD TV with Built in DVD playerLight weight space saving very attractive design Sharp Picture Good sound quality and quick response time DVD playback also excellent Only negative is its remote control It is hard to read the functions of the keys due to color choices The placement of the keys are almost illogical and you have to look at it carefully before each use It almost seems like it was designed by an imbecil The quality the features and the price still makes this TV an excellent buy"
"1","TERRIBLE DO NOT BUY THISI bought this for my wife for her birthdayand had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work I returned it and got a repalcement which once again the DVD player failed to work It is a piece of junk"
"1","BEWARE This TV is set so that it is not capable of a recall function If you want to flash back between channels this TV is not going to give it to you The remote control that comes with the TV has no recall function so I bought a Sony universal which is a much better remote that had the recall button on it However I soon learned that the TV is set at the factory to not have the capability to flashback It may not be a big deal to some but this user found it very annoying"
"2","Kitchen TVI bought this to replace a 13 tube tv in my kitchen What I gained was a larger screen plus relcaiming the counter space The picture is good and the internal DVD player is a bonus All in all a good purchase"
"2","Nice for the moneyThe first one I bought was defective The DVD didnt work at all I purchased it from Electronics Express and when I contacted them they were wonderful They gave me an RMA number right away Fedex picked it up the next day and a new one arrived 1 week later This one is just fine I really love the clarity of the picture My only complaint is that in DVD mode the sound isnt loud enough I have it in my RV and with the AC running I can barely hear it I solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the TV to the input on the RV stereo speaker system Its very lightweight and easy to move around and store A bonus for the RV The remote isnt great but it works just fine and the videoaudio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the DVD player All in all its a great deal for the price"
"1","Disappointed RomanianThis book in my opinion is biased and takes an angle of Europe that is clean and proper and fails to shed light on the rest of it I can understand that these are tourist guides and why would anyone want to tour a country forgotten by time However I am a very disappointed Romanian with this book and would never use it as my reference I have seen travel guides outlining Europe exclude Romania before but with the precision and detail of DKs series I was left yet again in disappointment"
"2","Great travel guide to EuropeThis book is realy great for everybody who likes to travel Europe The combination of good pictures illustration and texts is perfect You get a good overall view for the most important sights places cities and countries in Europe and also a bit of historical information As a European who already traveled a bit I still could find a lot of inspiration to more interesting places to go Thank a lot to Eyewitness Travel for there great books"
"1","Not the bestI bought both this and lonely planet and have used lonely planet more because this book is full of pictures but doesnt give you all the info you need Also I ended up buying each indiv city guide as well because this one only scratches the surface"
"2","Good but received defective bookI bought this book because we are moving to Germany and I wanted to get a good overview of all the countries in Europe that we could travel too Unfortunately pages 457480 on Greece are not in English looks to be Spanish There was some sort of printing problem But I found the rest of the book to give good highlights of the countries"

"1","Either 1 or 5 Stars Depends on how you look at itEither 1 or 5 Stars Depends on how you look at it1 Star because they sent 6 feet of 2 OD copper pipe0 Star because they wont accept returns on it5 stars because I figure its actually worth 1215foot and since they wont take a return I figure I can sell it and make 4050 on this deal"
"2","Hunting the Hard WayThia was a gift for my Husband who loved the book It arrived on the date we were told it would"
"1","DisappointingThe text is the same as ever I think but the plates are markedly inferior to all previous editions Had I known this ahead of time I would not have purchased this volume"
"2","Homer or MosesAn extremely helpful gem on a complex subject of second century religious authority and textual use For anyone serious about this period and the interelation of cultures this book is essential Is it complex and detailed Of course it must be to argue the point Should you buy it Yes unless you want to keep running back to the library I write this only after thoroughly disagreeing with the review above"
"1","Very poor qualityThe screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up The screen itself is very lightweight very cheesy looking The finish was worn across the entire top of the screen I knew this wasnt solid brass but I expected something that at least looked decent from a distance for the price I paid"
"1","Scraped across the whole topPurchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top The box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom However since it was in another smaller box Im thinking that the scraping was there to begin with and not from shipping Still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage I wouldnt want to risk getting another with the same damage and I really need a screen right now Other than the damage its a very nice screen"
"2","unknown AfricaYou dont expect music from africa to be so profesionally produced Me from the white world dont understand the lyrics but we do understand the music which is a mixture between salsa soukous and fado with always the african feeling for rithem The soft almost borred voice of Oliver Ngoma fits pefectly in the music The CD is recorded in France Paris you can hear that professionals have been working on the CD A must for a hot lazy nightgreetings Arno Amsterdam"

"1","Profound then Truly horrible nowThe narrative style of this work by famous founders biographer John Morse is arrogant flippant and frequently exaggerated It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate Perhaps considered penetrating for its day it really represents nothing more than opinion today The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now If it werent for the fact that Morse wrote this piece 110 years ago Id have rated it only one star"
"2","Definitely enjoyedThis was a gift for my 6 yr old daughter She is a big Barbie fan as well as loves to use the computer She is still enjoying this game She completed it in a few hours which worried me at first but she loves to do it over and over again The music is enjoyable and the colors are vibrant It seems to be very user friendly alsomy daughter has not really needed my help to use it once she started it the first time"
"2","Even Mommy has fun with this oneMy four year old daughter loves everything Barbie and loves the Rapunzel movie This game is tons of fun even for a 42 year old We love playing it together We love decorating all the rooms and finding the gems What even better is she can play it alone and I get some me time"
"2","Great combination of creativity and adventureMy 4 year old daughter has been addicted to this game She plays it over and over again She loves the opening song and has been singing it non stop She gets excited each time she completes a room and finds a gem and loves solving the maze to find Prince Stefan The only problem is that she sings the song so much I cant get it out of my head"
"2","RapunzelThis is such a great game both my 3 year old son and 7 year old daughter love it I like to play to if they would let me So much fun decorating the rooms and so many choices to keep you playing Great game Not at all what you would think a Barbie game would be Great fun for all"
"1","Not what I expected My daughter and I loved the movie She is 5 years old and it took her 2 hours to complete the game Absolutely no challenge and very little interaction It is essentially just clicking on the screen to make it play the 7 or 8 scenes it has programmed There are no games to play nothing to figure out nothing to do Save your money"
"1","barbie rapunzel crying childMy 6year old daughter is currently sobbing in her bedroom as a result of this rotten gameShe spent an hour on this game painting in pretty pictures and coloring in flowers But halfway through the game the program hung and wouldnt let us leave the room or click anywhere else Now even if we exit the game and then start it back up we are frozen in one spot while Barbies disembodied voice urges us to explore somewhere else in the castleStandard software troubleshooting and rebooting didnt help Vivendi Games support site is currently disabled And now Im left with a weeping frustrating child who doesnt understand that it is not her fault that her game wont work Im hoping it was just incompetent software programming that couldnt catch the bug my 6year old caught the first time around Or maybe they just dont care about the problems so long as you get our 20 bucks If you dont want a crying little girl avoid this game"
"2","Barbie as Rapunzel A Creative AdventureI purchased this software for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves playing it so much She lets me play it sometimes but she doesnt always like what I come up with I plan to purchase other software programs for her"
"2","Use your imaginationMy 3 year old daughter I both love this software We actually fight over who is going paint the pictures or choose the themes for each room This game allows you to be creative use your imagination by decorating each room of the castle and finding the missing gems to the princes crown which gives Rapunzel the power to find Prince Stephan who has been turned to stone bring him back to life The music animation is the best I have seen Most of the kids software that Ive seen is boring to me as an adult but this is not at all I sometimes like to play it without her There are so many variations on color schemes patterns that you can never be bored I highly recommend this for girls of all ages"
"1","Not so good ok for a rentalThis game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind The only bad thing is that there is only one castle for the kids to decorate and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it You either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like I did My sister finished the castle in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore It is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money"
"1","NOT OS X but MAC CLASSICNEGATIVE This game does not work with OS X and requires the CD so you cant have it on multiple computers It is slow I have to tell my daughter that it is thinking a lot this is because it has to access the CD everytime there is a new task You cant view the openning sequence again without throwing out the saved game files Some of the tasks and controls are too hard and not user friendly even for adultsit CRASHES all the timeMouse is jumpy and hard to usePOSITIVE Some tasks are easy possible to use grand and beautifulMy three year has enough patience to survive the multiple trials to get this to work"
"1","Bad DealI ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds the Vendor I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback I cant rate a DVD I have never seen I didnt bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it In the future I will watch for the name of the person andor persons I am buying from I thought they were a good company I understand a simple mistake but to not get a response at all is not good businees sense I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazoncom building my DVD collection I guess I will be more careful in the future"
"2","Smells divineThis is my second bottle of sheer freesia I just love this fragrance its a light delicate sent beautiful like a summer day"
"1","Very disappointedThis perfume is just AWFUL Smells nothing like freesiaThe gift recipient was not impressed The worst is that it cant be returned"

"1","audio options non existentWhile the movie in itself was better than i expected what i didnt expect was the non existent Thai soundtrack While the option was on the disc menu as well as stated on the package the Thai soundtrack does not exist No matter what you choose Thai or English English is what you get and while there are some exceptions most dubbing is ridiculous at best and the dubbing on this title is sub par While this review covers only the first movie of the two the other may remain in plastic never to see the inside of my dvd player Its a shame and a sham when you purchase what claims to be original and is not Very disapointed in this offering from Tokyo Shock"

"1","No instructions included do not trust sellerPromised with this item are Complete Instructions and the additional pledge that Sweet Graces will email you with the Supply List and Instruction sheets on purchase so you can be ready ahead of time I received none of this only a plastic figurine and bracelet To boot Amazon claims they can do nothing to help me contact the seller All I got was a phone number for the manufacturer Lets hope that yields some results Meanwhile Im wishing I had listened to previous feedback about this unreliable seller"

"1","Slow dull classical 1980s style movie2 stars of 5 for this slow dull classical 1980s style movie This movie has a young Jason Bateman in the lead Very very very slow and dull with a few moments of bad 1980s style music To our relief the background music which is very annoying is kept to a minimum Though it attempts to be an actionsuspense movie it achieves neither Id suggest skipping this movie"

"1","Very Not Worth Your TimeThe book was wriiten very horribly I would never in my life recommend such a book The stories lacked any mystery to them and did not leave me wanting to figure out who the culprit was The only good thing was that none of the stories took up ten or twelve pages"

"2","a great book for Historical romance loversThis is an engaging a count of life of Tess a girl who at a young age washed up on the shore of the Isle of May With no memory of the life before then she stays with the old caretakers of the isle After the caretakers are dead a young man Colin Macpherson washes up on shore Colin takes Tess back with her to his castle where he helps her uncover her past They are oppositesbut you know what they say opposites attract This book is just one of many in the Avon True Romance series I have read every book in the series and I know that if you like this book you love the rest This is a great book for girls about 10 to 16 because it is still a romance novel but not what you call a trashy romance novel It is a great novel fokr those who are just getting into romance novels"
"2","YESWhen I got this book I wasnt expecting much but man was I wrong I loved this book Now I may not usually be tied in by a man with long blond hair wearing a kilt but the authors really made Colin into this enchanting Highlander Tess is a very soft heroine While she sometimes seems too guillible I have to remember that it is part of the story This is one of my favorite books in the series"
"1","Not the best in the seriesTess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new lifeThe beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem The plot loses much of its believability mostly due to the poor characterization All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason Even Tess and Colins development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced The writing does improve towards the end but its not enough to save the book Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series skip this one"

"2","Very authenticThis is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping However the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesnt have anybody to ask for a clue it leaves a lot of questions unanswered for this however there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooksOn the brighter note I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba you cant go wrong with it"
"1","Not the bestI agree the CDs are a much needed help since it would be impossible to pronnounce the Yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker However the design of the book is really poor and confusing I have found several spealling mistakes in English and Yoruba And the grammar explanations are very hard to understandUnfortunately there are not many Teach Yourself Yoruba books that are worth it This one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills"

"2","One of a kind book for timber frame buildingMy husband loves this book He said he has learned so much and that this was the best book to learn how to build a timber frame house by"
"1","no technical informationthis book is a great over view of the joints used in building but has no information on beam spans or loads to actually build a building"
"2","Hanford Mills museumMy friend is a master carpenter and he saw this book at a recent trip to Hanford Mills museumHe is an avid reader and loved the book so much that I am inclined to read it as well Enjoy"
"1","you will not be able to buils a timber frame houseThis book vaguely breezed across history and went into various types of timber structures The mortise and tenon joints that were illustrated were fascinating but not practical for a home builder"
"2","Outstanding guidebook for building your own timberframe homeMy wife and I built a hybrid timber frame home using this book as a guide Although we have construction skills this book was invaluable in guiding us through the process We cant wait to build another We highly recommend this book to anyone considering a timber frame house"
"1","Excellent book very poor ebook editingYet another example of an superb book done a serious disservice by ebook publishersMultiple spelling errors improperly placed figures captions whole sections of the book written in CAPS for some reasonIf you are looking for an excellent reference on traditional timber framing look no further but please pick up the print version instead of the ebook"
"2","A very good howto manualIf you are expecting a book full of glossy sharp pictures this is not the one to buyA lot of drawings and BW pictures that inform what they need to This is a very good manual for those who want to venture in a timber frame project"
"1","Poor instructions but once you figure it out kinda coolThese wraps were not doing anything when we placed them in hot water We searched the internet and found others having the same problem The instructions are very poor First off you need to dip in boiling water or at least some temperature level above what I would call hot Second the instructions dont describe what should happen should the image shrink around the egg transfer to it whatNeedless to say it was frustrating for a minute or two but my wife who is very intelligent and great in the kitchen immediately thought well hot water wouldnt do much to change the properties of the plastic so lets try boiling water nothing to loseShould be more explicit in the instructions We were using the star wars version of this product"

"2","My HenryI had Henry back in the 70s I dont remember him with a nose since it was chewed off but he was well loved Hes long gone and I thought I was the only one who ever had a Henry since nobody knew what I was talking about I cant believe Ive found him again Nobody can replace my original worn Henry but Im so excited to have his clone back"
"2","Henry has come homeI had Henry back in the early 70s I am forty now and still have my original I bought a new one for my Dad who is ill because I knew he would get the significance Henry got me through the insecurities I had as a child and I am hoping he does the same for my Dad as he battles terminal cancerThanks for making him again"
"2","CharismaWhat it is about Henry Dog My daughter was 6 when we gave her Henry Love is not the word Obsession A few years later my exwife decided he had to go Under the guise of an incurable lice infection my exwife threw him out Trauma followed We bought a replacement which my daughter has safely on her closet shelf He is thread bare I found him online and was overwhelmed to read the reviews at Amazoncom None had less than 5 stars Each story told how this little guy had touched their lives These Henry owners both girls and boys cherished him as if he had been a real dog I guess to them he is Daddy had to buy his little 40 year old daughter a new one I got both the 14 and 3 I was on the phone when she opened the box Henry was home again My granddaughter saw Henry got excited and wanted one also She is 19 years old This company should bottle Henry Dogs charisma Thanks for keeping him alive"

"2","A Contemporary Fairytale Sure to DelightWhile this book is a takeoff on the classic Snow White its a fairytale for grown ups with some class act characters and a rich and rewarding love story I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and look forward to more of Ms Sinclairs works"
"1","Not Patterns but Detailed SketchesAlthough I was excited to purchase this book my excitement didnt last when I looked at the sketches pictures in the book I call them pictures because that is what they truly are not actual patterns Norma Gregorys talent shows up well in her designs but due to their complicated rendering they are very difficult to transferThis book is not for beginners but more seasoned artisansIf you are looking for patterns like I was you will be disappointed in this book"

"1","Product didnt match the picturedescriptionUnless they sent me the wrong product by mistake the foot cushion picture and description does not match the item delivered I was under the impression I would receive two a pair of water filled foot cushions that I could insert into my shoes Instead I received ONE foot cushion filled with another material not water that you attach to your foot via a toe strap I was definately not happy with the item and sent it back for a refund Luckily for me Amazon has a great return policy they make returns very easy"
"1","Good for a laughI heard about this book so I wanted to read it to see if it was as funny and stupid unintentionally as I heardI was not disappointed Few things in life are free and sex is defintely not among themThe perfect coda to this book is that the couple got divroced several years after publishing this book You cant make this stuff up"
"1","As Bad a Production as PossibleThis Broadway Theatre Archive production took one of the wittiest most sparkling 18thcentury comediesand ruined it The costumes are intentionally absurd think Beach Blanket Babylon the acting is way overthetopcamp and the incidental music could not be worse The music BTW is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern anything but 18th century The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly fusty old playI like The School for Scandal very much and not having found any other DVDs of it I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production But when they got into the extended bopbebop of the drinking song scene I knew I just couldnt ever sit through this one againThe visuals are also blurry but with the production being so bad so what Anyone who actually likes this play will be revolted by this DVD"
"1","Not professional qualityI first tried buying this tape from a Marketplace seller I sent it back because the tape quality was poor and the packaging looked unprofessional After returning it I bought one from Amazon proper and it was the same quality tape and the same packaging Since Im now sure this is not a bootleg tape all I can say is some videos are better than others"
"1","three to four stars dependingClassic drawing room comedy period piece Cleverly written in a time when the audience needed a bit of a nudge to figure out each character Each persons name describes how you should feel about each Charming idea from the 1700s If youve never had a chance to see one of these comedies take a look This is a famous play and well done Must see for theatre students"
"1","Good songs bad coverThis CD compilation set was purchased for me I love the 80s and they chose great songs The songs are not performed by the original artists Instead theyre poorly covered by the Starlite Singers"
"1","New Wave 80sI should have read the prior reviews of this record before buying it Although it appears to be a collection of new wave singles from the 80s these are just cover versions sung by the Starlite Singers The description of the record says that it is by various artists implying that they are by the original artists but this is not true Total garbage The one bright spot is that I got a prompt refund when I returned it"
"1","Dont Be FooledI bought this set last November and just now decided to listen to the CDs Nowhere in the description on Amazon does it say not the original artists In fact it says various artists which is deceiving because only one group performs all the songs It leads one to believe original artists when it says various artists because it is after all a compilation of music by various artists Duh So dont waste your money I will probably throw these in the trash as Im a purist and I want original not wedding reception music"
"1","Buyers BewareThis is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs These are NOT ORIGINAL SONGS BY THE ARTISTS If you loved KTEL CDs and dont care about hearing the artists originals and dont care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad then you might like this cd But if you are a fan of the 80s and the amazing music it produced then buy other collections and dont waste your money on this schlock"
"2","Sony basic Hi8 Handycam RocksPerformance is outstanding I had a previous Sony 8 mm Handycam which died and I replaced it with this camera so I could continue to playback my old 8 mm tapes This camera performs faster and is simpler to use than my old Sony It does everything I need and does it well I got a great deal"
"1","BEWAREBought this camera for Christmas Had her open it first so she could film the nights party NO TAPES ARE INCLUDED Of course all stores are closed Christmas day so the thing is USELESS until the day after Shame on Sony How much would a tape included in the packace cost them Not included Battery chargers are"
"2","80s High Tech with Rock EmotionAlthough all of Mr Hines work is high quality Waving Not Drowning for me is the highlight of the 3 AM projects The song Curious Kind is simply a masterpieceThe remastering is of the quality you have come to expect from one of Rocks greatest producers song writers and performersGET IT"
"1","Never gets goingThis book never really seems to get going There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspectdefendant are left unaskedAfter 200 pages I realized that this book wasnt going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very endAs a result the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier Based on the ending the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetentI did enjoy parts of the book however and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written"
"2","Now The Rest of the StoryI knew there was something missing from the first book when I read it because it didnt match what I heard her say years ago when she came to my church to speak Now I know the abuse was so difficult for her to talk about even when she wrote a book about it Later with the help of a trusted friend she was able to tell the most difficult and abusive parts of her childhood experience This what the second book is about The most wonderful thing about Dorie is that she is able to forgive her abusers and move on with her life She is still able to have a successful and happy life in spite of the horrendous abuse of her childhood This is what so many women need to hear With the Lords help it is possible"
"2","The baseball benchmarkI didnt refer to Baseball America as such It was Cardinals GM Walt Jocketty who said it And who am I to contradict The best columnists in the game from Peter Gammons Tracy Ringolsby and Jayson Stark to detailed information in ALL of baseball from the Major Leagues to Japan stats scores and the best and most extensive resource on prospect information theres not a single serious fan in all of baseball who deserves such a title if is not a Baseball America subscriber You got to read it if you want to know the stars of tomorrow being tomorrow 6 years or 2 months Top 10 prospects from every team till its massive Top 100 list Baseball America covers it all I know I have been subscribed for 2 years now and I cant think of living without it"
"2","Perfect for the diehard baseball fanI have read Baseball America off and on over the years and finally took the plunge and got a subscription This is the best place to get coverage of the minors college and high school baseball so you know about the top prospects before others do"
"1","Uh oh hes been using Brand XAn embarassment Steer clear of this one folks Just when you thought these guys were the last real fusion types aboutSince when did the last great secret of the fusion world start taking pointers from Joe Satriani and listening to old Al DiMeola pratice sessions Where the hell is Phil when you need him oh yes Tarzan The star is for the Bruford and WildingBonus tracks and well does one really want those"
"2","This was an intriguing book that influenced my destinyI read Trouble on Titan around 1970 when the Apollo program was at its apex and the human exploration of the Solar System seemed only a short step away My review is based on old memories but I can still remember a mining colony on Titan and jet craft using oxygen for fuel and burning Titans methane atmosphere Weve learned much since this book was written and Titans atmosphere has less methane than we originally thought However this book was well written and I am sure will intrigue my son as much as it intrigued his father who is now working at NASA on the CassiniHuygens mission to Saturn and Titan This book has that oldstyle scifi flavor that made another world seem more like reality than fantasy I think if you enjoyed the Lucky Starr and David Starr stories by Asimov you will enjoy Trouble on Titan"
"2","Peek a FunWe got these as a gift for our one year old He loves them He tries very hard to get all the little things out of the blocks and obviously fails He loves that some of them move some of them jiggle some of them make noise its almost an adventureThe three year old also loves them because they incorporate the alphabet and he can easily identify the items inside B Banana P Penguin U Umbrella Z ZebraBonus when the 1 yo gets frustrated because he cant pry the items out of the block no matter how hard he tries he usually flings them The 3 yo tends to use them to build walls or towers for the sole purpose of smashing another toy into them or dropping them off high places And Ive stepped on two of them already They seem to tolerate this treatment rather well"
"2","Excellent productThese Alphabet blocks are so beautiful they could be classed as works of art or collectors items I have purchased two seys as gifts and will probably buy more"
"1","Great for TwinsI purchased the Alphabet blocks for my twin daughters They are just over 8 months old and they love them This product is a great learning tool for them for years to come but for now it a great teething toy I would recommend this to anyone plus I love Fisher Price"
"2","Theyre blocks keep that in mindWe got these after seeing the Incrediblocks in the FP CatalogThere are little to no pizazz to the blocks Some have features where you can spin them like the letter Q Queen or the W watermelon seeds that rattle but most are just a look at me type of a blockWith that in mind yes I like the product Theyre blocks Theyre meant for stacking knocking over and banging which my son loves hes had these since he was 6 months Theyre better than the plain wooden blocks because theyre textured they have objects inside letters lots of opportunities to learn letters colors objects descriptions etcFor now hes stacking banging and knocking over Itll be around for a while until hes ready to learn more words colors objects animals This review isnt profound or eye openings because again theyre just blocks Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision It will not make your child an overnight rocket scientist"
"1","Would have expected betterI bought these for two reasons blocks and educational letters However the letters are rubbing off For the price I paid that was dissapointing Other than that I love the concept and the objects inside are fun"
"2","Cute gift for a little babyAlthough I felt it looked a bit chinsy the mother had it on her wish list and was very happy to receive them"
"2","Great BlocksMy daughter loves her blocks She will get them all out and look at each one until she finds her favorite She likes to shake them and see what each one does These are cute little blocks that have hours of imaginative playtime inside They also have blunt corners so no sharp edges like wood blocks for the safety of smaller children The fact that they have the letters of the alphabet and a corresponding object inside makes them a great learning tool even for older tots We have really enjoyed these and recommend them to our friends"
"2","Awesume BEST BLOCKS EVERTHIS TOY WAS OUR GRANDSONS FAVORITE SO I JUST HAD TO FIND IT AGAIN FOR OUR NEWEST GRANDCHILD THANK GOODNESS FOR ONLINE SHOPPING"
"2","keeps his attentionMy little boy is just getting interested in these blocks They are too cute Hes learning to manipulate the block in his hands The little things inside the blocks are adorable Some spin some twirl some rock A definate upgrade from the standard wooden blocks"
"2","Great valueThis set incorporates a lot of the favorites from other sets packaged in an A to Z learning format I have been leary of purchasing too many of these blocks for storage reasons so the zippered case is a great bonus Definitely worth every penny"
"2","Wonderful but not worth 80These are great blocks but they are definitely not worth the listed 7999 They can be purchsed for about 20 many other places"
"2","Worth the investmentThis is a great set of blocks I researched different blocks for some time and found these to be the most durable age and developmentallyappropriate and highlyeducational 25 bucks may seem like a lot but I think it is well worth it I am very impressed with the qualityThe size and shape of the blocks is just right My son is 5months old and he is able to hold the blocks perfectly in his little hands PLUS the blocks do not have sharp corners like the wooden blocks also available on this site that could hurt your little one especially those of you with chewersOne category that I rated this toy with only a 4 instead of 5 is the fun factor For younger babies that may not get it yet this toy may not be as fun for them until they are a little bit older My son is not yet able to fully comprehend that there are even toys inside the blocks but then again he is only 5 months Give him a couple of months and hell really dig them"

"2","Pretty NiftyI purchased these for a Halloween party and thenlike a dummy I forgot to put them up Nevertheless I did hold them up around the house in search of a good place to hang them Theyre pretty big and look really cool Id say theres a little bit of educational value too as you can teach your children about the actual pictures theyre depicting Even though I forgot to hang them up I really liked these scene setters and Ill be using them next year"

"1","It was ok but I wont watch it againI watched this last night And I dont remember enough of it to give it a indepth review But it wasnt as bad as people are letting on nor was it as great as people are letting on If you dont like your killer to be supernatural then dont bother with this Its about a guy that comes back from the dead His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place The acting wasnt bad at all and neither were the deaths In fact it was kinda gory But that doesnt make a great movie The flashbacks were a little confusing as well I wouldnt watch it again But its far from the worst movie Ive seen"
"2","Loved it PS Stephen Colletti is so hotI initially bought the movie just because Stephen Colletti who Im in love with was one of the leadsand I really didnt expect much from what looks to be a lowbudget indie horror flick But I really did like it The lead girl who plays Jennifer Nikki DeLoach is really good I cant believe Ive never seen her in anything before Maybe I have but I didnt know It was cool to see the guy from Weekend at Bernies Terry Kiserhe is a really good actor Too bad he was dead the whole time in both movies I saw him in lol Anyways this was a cool movie and Im glad I got it"

"2","NOT the worst American BMovieThis movie was a horror film thhat displayed an effort to steer clear of typical horror movie dialogue and pacing There are no blonde girls and the girls that are here dont trip over the tree roots in the yard Now a white girl did fall and twist her knee in the movie but guess what It was not on a tree root"
"1","MASK OF FAMILIARITYMASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathyMASK MAKER isnt the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesnt tread new waters either The cast performs on various levels of competence WEEKEND AT BERNIEs Terry Kiser is an effective guiltridden buffoon Treat Williams is illused in a cameo role Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female Doomed fiance Stephen Colletti sic is equally flaccidAn openended finale paves the way for MASK MAKER IIsomething we definitely dont need"
"1","UnmaskedSadly there is absolutely nothing original in this movie The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers I couldnt find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films The plot is standard a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history A standard run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until its too late Everything happens exactly on cue in order with no surprises and no frights This movie is safe and boring it really couldnt have been any better if it tried Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman playing a nice guy for a change can help the dullness of the scriptEven the title is a misnomer Although the original title Maskerade isnt any betterAnd I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres"
"2","A museum exhibit inside a bookThis book was in my librarys Genealogy section and youre not allowed to take Genealogy books out of the library But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it in two sittingsThis a quick read because it has loads of pictures photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards work certificates yellow stars etc Its more like a museum exhibit than a simple book Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too although it is clearly written for adults Certainly it probably has the most information on the KovnoKaunas ghetto all in one placeBoth researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy thisBonus pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra ZaprudersSalvaged Pages Young Writers Diaries of the Holocaust"

"1","Stiff and Smells like drying paintYou get what you pay for This pillow is stiff and smelled like drying paint for 4 days I thought I was getting a non name brand version of the Temperpedic pillow I bought the real pillow for my mother years ago and paid many times the price This thing doesnt even come close"
"1","Review of PillowThis was a joke I am sending the pillow back Does not come close to what was advertised I believe the cardboard box that it arrived in would have been softer under my head I am giving it one star just so I can post this I only wish the stars could go negative"
"1","Dont botherThe pillow is tiny and poor quality foam my pillow I was replacing was at least a year and a half old and it preforms better than this one did new"
"1","Worthless and cheapHow is this thing awful let me count the waysFirst off it took an unatural amount of time to get here Whatever that happensIt feels super cheap When you handle a good memory foam pillow it feels heavy and cushy in your hands This thing feels like a piece of hard styrofoam It barely squishes at all and has no memory it is simply a very dense foam pillow Its not even really a pillow Its so hard that I cant even use it for propping my back whilst readingOn top of that their terrible return pollicies make it not worth returningDO NOT BUY Just use the styrofoam your new computer came inUgh"
"1","Will not be purchasing another one of theseIt worked fine in the beginning 2 months or so into using it its performance was up in the air I would find myself sleeping with one hand under the pillow to give it some leverage otherwise my neck would end up in an awkward position At times it felt like I needed to have 2 pillows because it was lacking in width and was too soft I had to also rotate what end and what side I would lay my headneck on It therefore did not provide the support I needed"
"1","False AdvertisementThe pillow I received is nothing like the one in the picture The pillow that I received is approx half the size in thickness as the one I received I am not happy with the seller Moshelles I will never purchase from this company ever again I am currently deployed Military and I feel that this company is very disrespectful and does not show its Military members the proper courtesy when dealing with such issues Do not buy this pillow you will not be satisfied"
"1","Not Like the Old FormulaThe formulation of this product has been changed since Artec was bought by LOreal The new formula doesnt hold hair like the old Artec original formula did and it doesnt smell as nice Dont be fooled by this picture 122907it is a pic of the old Artec bottle but I ordered and received the new LOreal Professionel version which is terrible The original Artec version was similar to but not as sticky as Potion 9 I wish LOreal would go back to the old formula I emailed them to this effect and they never even replied If anyone can recommend a similar product please comment to this review"

"1","DO NOT BUY A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIMEMy daughter wanted this for a few months before I finally gave in and bought it for her She was so excited We got home and played it for one hour hoping that something different or better would happen The game was so so boring You get to choose music outfits and which of the three skaters to skate That is IT Everything else is controlled automatically by the game Barbie does everything perfectly whether you do or not My daughter hasnt played it since and is so disapointed in it The store I bought it from wont let me return it because it has been opened They will let me exchange it for the exact same game but hello that is the problem This game was a waste of time and money"
"1","Bad skating techniqueI didnt buy this game becuase I can tell by the pictures that Barbie has very bad skating technique see below This game is not for kids who want to have fun while seeing a good skating programPictures on Amazon1 Box picture I cant tell whether or not Barbie is stroking or doing a bad spiral Either her leg is too high if she is stroking or her body and leg are not in the right position if she is doing a spiral2 Layback Although its hard to see it looks like Barbie might be spinning on her toe pick3 Split jump Barbie does not have enough skating muscle for the jump She is also not kicking her boots upPictures on vugames makers of the game1 Stroking Barbies body is crooked She doesnt have her weight over her stroking leg and her body is leaning to the side Ive never seen anyone stroke like this"
"1","A complete wasteMy daughter received this cd for Christmas It is very slow loading lots of wait time for things to happen When she finally chose the skater and where she should skate only one choice worked my daughter kept asking what she could do now Most of the time we were watching Barbie skate beautifully Not very interactive I consider this a waste of space on my computer a waste of time for us to use I would recommend saving your money and get something worthwhile"
"1","4 year old BORED with this after 2 weeksI bought this for my 4 year olds birthday While I think the graphics are really great the concept stinks My daughter told me she thinks it is boring and she LOVES Barbie and last night she even said she hates it At least my 15 month old screams with delight at the graphics when her older sister plays with it"
"1","Barbies Boring Ice ShowI bought this game because I am a figure skating fan and found the Barbie Gymnastics to be well done so I thought that this would be too It was an absolute waste of money The graphics are awful and the game play is far too simplistic There is nothing to strive for in the game and it is too easy to pass onto the next level I cant imagine a child above the age of 3 or 4 getting any enjoyment from this game"
"1","WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY BARBIE HAS SUNK TO NEW LOWSThis is the WORST CDROM game I have ever seen My 7yearold daughter longed for this game all Christmas season and she is bored out of her mind with it after one hour It is slow skippy etc running on a new computer Dont waste your money like we did skip right over this dud"
"2","ITS GREATAll the other reviews say this product is boring and save your moneyWell my daughter I LOVE ITYou get to pick one of three pretty girl skaters You pick her one of AT LEAST 15 costumes Somebody said the skater never falls Thats boloney She falls plenty until you develope the hand eye coordination this FUN FUN game takes Its a GREAT cdrom for any age Have some fun for petes sake This world is SO NEGATIVE I Highly Recommend Barbie Sparkling Ice Show"
"2","A good game to buyI bought this game for my daughter who is almost seven She enjoys it very much It works perfectly with Windows XP I like the fact that it has skill levels which helps avoid the frustration factor which Im sure most of you reading this have experienced The only reason that I did not give it a 5 is because it is quick to complete especially on the easy and medium levels Unless your child is totally into figure skating or Barbie I feel this game is not for the 8 crowd"
"2","Great GameMy daughter almost 7 loves this game She got it a few weeks ago and still plays with it every day We did have to upgrade our system but the game hasnt crashed since and hasnt been slow Despite what others have said this game has lots of levels and takes lots of practice to master the freestyle levels The skaters will do lots of different tricks once the user learns how to do them This game has even seemed to help my daughters actual skating she just went yesterday for the first time since receiving the game and had lots more confidence and moved more smoothly than she did the other times she went"
"1","Not really what I wantedFor anybody whos looking for the 1978 movie with Lauren Bacall this is not it Actually its a 12 minute CBS music video by a group called Perfect Gentleman with 2 titles on it Ooh la la and One more Chance This is not a rating of this video I didnt bother watching it but just of the fact that theres absolutely no information in the Amazon product details which could have told me this wasnt the feature film I was looking for before I ordered it Thats even more a pity as it was the fastest delivery I ever got from the US to Europe by Mail a very shortlived joy"

"2","The most charming captivating work from LJ SmithThe plot and characters are incredible Everyone that likes the supernatural should read this book and all the other Night World books I think Im in love with Ash"
"2","Beautiful Love StoryI usually hate teenage romance books but this book is great I love the transition the characters go through and the romance This is my favorite Night World beacuase of its characters and sitiuations She mixes charm romance and humor This book feels like real even though it is horror which makes you wonder My favorite line in the book is This is a paranormal disaster area"
"2","The Best YetDaughters of Darkness is the best yet I happened to pick it up by mistake in the Library and I Got hooked right away I must have read it 50 times I loved the way Ash Tried to protect her from Jermey but she saved herself I really hope theres another book on those two"
"2","The BestI just reread Daughters of Darkness for about the 100th time and I just enjoy it more every time I read it It has everything that you could want and more Just one questionAre MaryLynnette and Ash ever going to find happiness together or will they be forced to spend their lives apart longing for the one person who can make their life completeTo find out keep reading"
"2","SoulmatesI have read nearly all of the books in the Nightworld series and I have to say that this one is my favourite without a doubt It is Ash of course that just makes this book he is irrestible I became hooked on him from the very first I guess its the whole badboy vampyre thing hes got going on that you become addicted to him I started reading these books years ago but they went out of print I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them I would recommend these books to anyone of any age I mean Im 21 now and I still love them"
"2","Possibly the Best out of this seriesIt was this book nearly 10 years ago that made me fall in love with LJ Smith and her writing I have read nearly everything by her in the years after my first encounter with Daughters of Darkness yet this book remains dear to my heart The characters pop out of the pages and you fall in love instantly with Rowan Jade and Kestrelbut you will especially fall in love with Ash Look for Ash again in the 6th book of the series when he makes another appearance This book is fantastic"
"2","AmazingLJ smith is a fantastic author who inspires others to create stories and poetry that shows their true brilliance Daughters of Darkness has a special quality about it which induces feeling of love and adventure all at the same time I would not be surprised if people respond well to this novel"
"2","One of the best books Ive ever readDAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS was the first book by L J Smith that Iread and I was hooked after that I loved the way L J Smithdescribed all the characters especialy Ash and gave them all completely different personalities This is by far one of the best books Ive ever read and I cant wait for STRANGE FATE to come out For anyone who is looking for another good series by L J Smith I suggest the Vampire Diaries and Dark Visions trilogies"
"2","Daughters of DarknessTHE BESTIve read all of LJ Smiths books up until TheHuntresswhich of course isnt out yetand Ihave to say that Daughters of Darkness wasprobably the best Night World so far Imobsessed with Ashand MaryLynette was just awesomeANYBODY AND EVERYBODY MUST READ THIS BOOK"
"2","One of her best in the Night World seriesOut of all LJSmiths works this is one of my most highly recommended If you have read any other books in the Night World series you will have recognized Ashone of the main characters who seems to pop up in many scenes The heroine Mary Lynette is also one of my favorite characters During the entire novel she dosnt appear as shaken as most would after learning of the Night Worldfinding her soulmate vampire and befriending 3 rogue vampires Even if this series is unrealistic what better kind of book to lose yourself in I find the whole concept of the Night Worldwild powers and soulmates fascinatingthis book is worth it"
"2","2 Humans and 3 vampires after a vampire slayerI just loved Daughters of Darkness I must of read it about 50 times really Its such a good story line you just have to read it tunes of times But it didnt really explain how Jeramey got there How would he how where they were going"
"2","Im hooked and I want some more Ive only read up to Soulmate of the Night World series but sofar Ihappen to be in agreement with almost all the other reviewers Ash is my favourite male character Did anyone notice that so far only Ash and MaryLynnette tried to fight their attraction But why was it called Daughters of Darkness when Rowan Kestrel and Jade werent actually the main charactersPS I think L J Smith should let more characters become vampires And how come all the maincharacter vampires are all male and the witches female"
"2","LJ Smith has so many correct detailsIm writng again to say that this book has so many correct details and the other books in this series are correct too For instance Speelbound has it right calling the Salem witch hunts the Burning Times real witches do to Isis is a a major person in witchcraft and Hecate was the first witch Lj Smith might as well be a wtich or vampire or whatever else for all the right details she has"
"2","It was greatI like it It was very cool to read about vampires and other legendary cratures of the night"
"1","DisappointingI bought this book because I am a nonogram also called Paint By Number addict and cant get enough of this type of puzzle My disappointment is not so much with the quality of the puzzles within it but with the quality of the publishing The paper is poor quality it wont hold up under much erasing if you use pencil and if you use gel pens the ink bleeds through to the other side The squares to color in are too large making the finished image very pixillated and hard to make out Also the guide numbers are located at the right and bottom edges of the puzzle instead of left and top making it more difficult for a righthanded person to see while solvingSave your money and buy the Games Magazine publication instead"
"2","mirroring the readerI find it fascinating that this wonderful glimpse into our nation shortly before the American Revolution could be thought of as stuffy boring and a waste of time Hofstader a brilliant and yet very human scholar has offered us a wonderfully concise compelling and illuminating read a rare and precious gift to anyone wishing to examine the evolution of our nation He has done all the work not only allowing us to form our own conclusions from the facts rather than spoonfeeding us his unsubstantiated opinion but has presented this vast amount of data in a breezy very readable manner The only explanation I could arrive at of how anyone could find this great book a waste of time is that these reviews are as much a reflection of the reviewer as the book under reviewBravo Professor Hofstader I regret that you did not live to complete your masterpiece"
"1","Dont Waste Yout TimeUnless you are under obligation to read this for some sort of class I would not recomend wasting yout time trying to wade through the quagmire of redundantly long boring text If I could pay attention to it for more than two sentences at a time most likely I would find it to have a wealth of information but its dry overlyintellecual style makes it impossible to stay interested If youre looking for a challenge to read you face two deciphering the nealry 300 pages of rediculously long sentences and staying awake I even go so far as to say reading it is a complete waste of time because the energy you must invest to understand this work coupled witht the frustration of an endlessly boring stlye does not even compared to the information you will actually get out of it"
"1","Thick dry and packed full of somewhat useful informationTo read this book you need to be fully awake and have full concentration This is not the type of book to bring to the beach Though Richard Hofstadter makes a convincing case of what colonial times were like and he obviously was a scholar he writes very monotonously if not thouroughly interested in american history at 1750 i would not recommend this book otherwise if you are a historyfanatic this book gives a wide range of perspectives and fully covers the history of the time"
"2","Kylie takes a bite at subtletyKylie Minogue isnt a very subtle performer shes famous for hiNRG floorfillers not purring ballads A ballad in the hands of a pop singer can be a nightmare but with Kylie its a dream and CHOCOLATE is a perfect example of it Sweet and slow it flows like its namesake throughout with a catchy chorus that will for sure melt her fans down Remixed for release this CD also includes the funky CITY GAMES two remixes the EMO mix is the better one and a live track taken from her BODY LANGUAGE LIVE DVD which should receive a late 2004 release in the USA"
"2","A rare wondeful treatI was extremely lucky to have found this because it is a an import b limited editionespecially lucky to find just thrown in the kylie section of a Pennsylvania Borders Ok here it is trackbytrack1 Chocolate Radio EditWhile this cuts the album version of the song by one minute and two seconds its better Her vocals are improved more of an arrangement is used 10102 City Games THis extreme rarity is fabulous Very RB pop 10103 Chocolate Tom Middleton Cosmos Remix A club dub Cool when you have so much energy in you that you have to dance it out but not for a regular listen 7104 Chocolate EMO Mix Woderful A good RB dance mix of the song 9105 Love First Sight Live A live version of the Fever hit I usually love live sounds but this when isnt quite up to par with the original 810I still have yet to figure out how to access the video Overall great package great mixes great rarities"

"2","Grandson enjoyed maybe 20 timesFine Boys and the toys or trains I forget how many times kids can watch a movie and then watch it again"
"1","Very annoyingThis video is really a disappointment it came with a Thomas piece so naturally my daughter picked it and I thought the bonus feature wouldnt be mixed in with the actually Thomas stories but I was wrong My daughter easily lost interest when the people would come on and talk about loving Thomas and getting to ride the real Thomas train I was totally annoyed"
"1","Extremely Disappointed with this videoI never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video Its 70 listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30 Thomas related What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story And there is only one song in the Sing A Long I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter Next time I will try to find those stories on video They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I dont know"
"1","Just sosoThis is a DVD with footage of a Come Out and Meet Thomas day mixed in between the episodes Sort fo a promotional piece to be honest Still decent enough to rent The DVD extras are limited and not very good My son seems to like it o kay but it gets pushed aside for more interactive stuff to be found on Sodor Celebration There is also a ton of toys shown during the partyinterview footage which can be a good or bad thing depending on how much you need to control that sort of thing with your child Also I for one get annoyed at the interviewes not sure why they just annoy me This production has the feel of an old VHS video copied to DVD without much added to it I wouldnt throw it out but I wouldnt buy it either"
"1","More than Thomas Not Geared Toward Children As MuchI bought this thinking it would be packed with Thomas stories Turns out there are only ten which is a typical Thomas DVD However between each story it also has interviews with parents and their kids about what they like about Thomas As I parent Im not interested in this and I know that my 3 year old would rather watch Thomas than a bunch of strangers any day Plus the singalong section has one song One We have other Thomas videos that has at least 4 and they arent special DVDs just normal Thomas collections I wouldnt recommend this to anyone if you are looking for solely Thomas stories and can find other collections"
"1","A long promo for the Thomas centersUnless I missed something there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms Allcroft Waste of money"
"1","Poor DVDHas too many interviews with people at the Live THomas day in Penn My kids were annoyed and hated this DVD"
"1","My Son finds it annoyingMy 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed my son couldnt care less He just wants to see trains We have a portable DVD player and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions and he and I just ends up frustrated My advice pick another DVD"
"1","Feels like a commercialAll the interspersed kid and parent interviews where they talk about all the trains they have just feels like a thinly disguised effort to sell more productIts also AWFULLY frustrating that you cant jut buy the DVD Series here as you can in the UK but have to make do with compilations where there are invariably episode duplicationssigh"
"2","Makes you not want to sleep at nightThis is about a kid who when asleep unleashes something horrific part two of the night warriors it is a brilliantly done novell and i recommend this to anyone who is a gore fanatic and masterton lover"
"1","25K warranty isnt included in packaging or at APC siteThis product description is WRONG I purchased this product because of this 25000 equipment warranty Product received only states that the actual surge protector is under warranty and has no mention of equipment warranty Is Amazon starting to make stuff up now"
"2","Great little surge protectorGreat value for a surge protector Ive got em on lots of electronics printers phones laptops that dont need a full power strip or universal power supply UPS Very portable for laptops in case youre travelling"
"1","Too SmallI have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are Even with the stretch waist band they are tight So much for an extra inch Beware Try these in a store before you buy"
"2","A good product available in convenient range of sizesThis product earns five stars not just because it is comfortable to wear and looks good but because it is available in more size inseam ranges than other Dockers products And by ordering online one can largely avoid the disappointment of store stock outs"
"1","TOM ATKINSON REVIEWI DID NOT GET THE SLACK THAT HAD THE WAISTBAND I GOT SLACK WITH NO WAISTBAND SO I SEND THEM BACK AN WAS TRYING TO GE A 42 29 BUT I RECEIVED A E MAIL STATETING THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NO LONGER AVABILITY SO FAR IAM NOT SURE WERE MY REFUND WENT PLEASE LET ME KNOWTOM ATKINSON"
"1","Cut smaller than usualI agree these are cut small Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do The waist band does NOT stretch"
"1","Wrong item sentI got the shippment quickly But wrong items was sent I have to return it to the seller I got the refund pretty quick but only for the value of product I spent about 10 for two way shipping without geting anything"
"1","Too badDid not like the pants at all and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage Flimsy smelled of dye cheap fabric etc Too bad"
"2","Dockers do the jobThis product was just what I was hoping for and I had no problem with shipping I highly recommend this product"
"1","False advertisingIf you search for Super Saver shipping this advertisement comes up but this product is not shipped by Amazon is does not go out with the Super Saver shipping and the cost of shipping is nearly 20 the cost of the pants"
"1","Dont Trust the ImagesDockers are Dockers so thats not the problem Just be sure you dont trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon Cafe for example should be Coffee Despite the fact that the image for Cafe shows a stone or very light gray color Cafe is actually dark brown So the product isnt defective but IS misleading I didnt want brown pants but thats what I got"
"1","So disappointedI have worn these pants for years my size is the same as always I couldnt get them on they were so tight I couldnt get the button buttoned around the waist What is going on These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old not someone who is a little on the hefty side Further the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight1695 above and beyond the already rather pricy product I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling and there are deals out there from major store chains I was really disappointed in this product and the seller Go to WalMart and get their khakis they are very inexpensive and wear like iron"
"2","Fantastic BookThis book is a modern retelling of Sleeping Beauty with an emphasis on the power of family to help a boy through a terrible time It is best suited for a mature inquisitive child War is a reality that parents should not shy away from talking about to their children"
"1","DisturbingAlthough the images are very well rendered they arefrightening I am baffled about the impression this book is supposedto leave on children This book may be picked up on the thought that it is a retold fairy tale when it is an abstract and grim retelling of the horrors of WWII in Berlin The most horrifying image is that of Major Kreigs big black gloves enveloping the body of the little boy This book is NOT appropriate for younger readers I can see how this book might be valuable for an alternative look at the war for middle schoolers or higher"
"2","A Taste of ItalyLonging for vicarious travel Imagining your college days interrupted by an Italian adventure which turns into one of the romantic kind And full of the silly things that come with youth attraction and confusion I just wanted to add my twocents on this item which I found despite brief lapses in credibility and hoppingly gullible moments sufficiently engaging to remind me of my love of Rome And now I have an even greater appreciation for the breadth and depth of Italian culture and character and the wonders of eating their special dishes Fun and satisfying"
"2","Perfect book for a long flight or a lazy afternoon This book is like watching a romantic movie It is interesting feel good and tasty Capella has done a good job of holding the readers interest with fun descriptions of food chefs Rome locals and the Italian countrysideI happened to pick this book up at a used book store and I am glad I did Youll like this book if you are a romantic a foodie love to travel love Italy and Italian food or all of the above"
"2","Delicious readingI found the book to be lighthearted fun and relatively fastmoving True it was predictable but that didnt detract from Capellas take on the triad of Bruno Laura and Tomasso In fact it was nice to see how Cappella put his spin on the Cyrano story The descriptions of the food and the locale enhanced the story and added to the atmosphere though at times were a trifle overdone pun intended The only thing that kept me from giving this a 5 was the authors descriptions of the sex scenes which were at times too graphic too male perhaps like reading PlayboyPenthouse letters for my taste In all though the book was entertaining and a fun way to occupy a few summer afternoons"
"2","Wonderfully romantic book that sweeps you to ItalyTHE FOOD OF LOVE is absolutely amazing From page one I felt like I was in Italy smelling the smells seeing the sights and above all tasting the foodThis book is for those who love life in all its sensual glory who believe in recognizing your soul mate at first sight and who think that fairy tales can come true I devoured the book pun intended from start to finish It made me appreciate food and its preparation and were booking a trip to Italy as soon as possible to discover some of the dishes describedWhat Water for Chocolate did for Mexican food this does for Italian There is magic in preparing food for those you love This is a fable a romance in the medieval sense of the word Its about the magic and wonder of food and love the sensual beauty of the world"
"2","I just wanted to cook for my husband on those dark and stary nightsThis book is better than ANY of the great trashy historical romances I have EVER read I love to cook I love to eat I love my husband This book made a great week for all three It was an inspiration for me to perfect a couple of things cooking and uhmmmm If you want to get INSPIRED too then read this book Id pair it with a couple of cooking books like Cooking in the Nude the one for newlyweds Booty Food Intercourses or something like that Enjoy a great book"
"2","One of the bestIf you are looking for something that entertains tells a great story and inspires you to want to go to Italy and fall in love with someone or with the food this is the perfect book I recommend it as mandatory reading for all groups I bring to Italy All who have read it especially women love it"
"2","CameriereI enjoyed this book it was much better than the standard chick lit titles It was a lightweight story easy to read and the Roman food cooking markets and people were fun Didnt mind the creative cursing how very true to Roman young stud it was Maybe the Laura character was a bit underdeveloped but I much prefered to read about BrunoI liked this book SO MUCH more than Cooking for Mr Latte it was a fun read"
"2","Food porn and I mean that in the best possible wayI didnt like the ending the characterization leave something to be desired and the writing didnt make me think but oh I didnt notice any of that Well except for the ending at the time or even until substatially after it was all over During I read and read bathing in the glorious food descriptions not to mention the allure of Italy Oh Yes"
"2","Chick Lit for FoodiesWhat a great read tips on cookinglovemaking and Italian insults Laughed and laughed Thanks Looking forward to film"
"1","Not very goodI bought this book to read as I myself ventured the streets of Italyand to my dismay the book was horrible I searched everywhere for the book here in the states and it was sold out everywhereand to be honest I am not sure why All of the characters were not very well depicted except for Laura The description of Rome and the other cities the book took place in where not vivid And the plot very predictible The addition of the mafia in the story could have also been completely taken outthere was no need for it in the book I just cant seem to think of anything really good to say about this bookmaybe the recepies at the end are good to cook"
"1","Do not waste your timelousyThis is one of the worst written books I have ever readI wish I had saved my money and my timeThe book is full of superlatives Everything is the best ever experienced again and againThe characters NEVER become embraceable One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware but is really just stupid Her friend is promiscuous which is all we ever really get to know of herThe writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader But the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader Very inappropriateNot sure who would really like this bookMaybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot story development characterization or any other facets of literatureFind yourself something with a little more substance and I think youll be much happier"
"1","The food is sexier than the sexThis book as all about the joy of eating and cooking and loveIts a lot better when it deals with food than with love In fact food is not only a metaphor for love and lovemaking but seems a more than adequate substitute People have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizingI can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot openly cribbed from Cyrano de Bergerac The most enjoyable parts are the opening chapters After that the returns swiftly diminishStill for a plane ride one could do worse I suppose"
"1","Back to basicsGenerally speaking a great book if you are not familiar with management accounting and turning heaps of information into valuable reports for your top management group No doubt about it This book will provide the basic tools for keeping your boss happy especially if you need a brushup on moving averages etc Having vast experience with both advanced financial and nonfinancial analysis on various aspects of business shipping and construction this book was somewhat a let down in terms of ability to inspire and provide ways to improve personal skills to structure and present complex topics in an ordered and clear fashion A nice bedtablereader for the preMBA MBAs should look elsewhere"

"1","Just as trashy as garbage music comesI listen to every kind of music in existence and I always give everything a chance But now Im permanently going to start ignoring every CD with a CASH MONEY record label on it Theyre CASH MONEY Millionaires and why Because they fill a CD with a bunch of horrible songs and repetitive beats Theyre millionaires because they repeat the words huh what and yeah for every 3 or 4 minute song they make Theyre millionaires because people who expect this kind of music to be the next BIG thing make them millionaires Bottom line HotBoys are garbage and so is every other artist signed onto the Cash Money label I will NEVER consider this good music and I hope that this is just a passing fad because if this is what socalled hiphop music is coming tothen I only hope its worth your money cause I aint gonna spend a penny on it"

"2","Worst music everbut I love itI dont know if you can actually call this music It is truly terrible However I love listening to it for some strange music I am not normally a fan of rap music but I laugh out loud every time I hear some of these songs These Cash Money guys should be comedians Except for Juvenile since I cant understand anything he says which is also rather funny Dont buy it for the music but it for the comedy"

"1","Please try another Hot Boy albumGuerriula Warfare is an album I fell is something and that something is everything The lyrics are most of the time meanless and pointless Also the beat and backround music of the songs sometimes dont even fit could for the lyrics or how the rapper is rapping Overall please go out and get another Hotboy album or something Or just another album in the lines of Cash Money just please not this one"
"2","Fun To Listen ToThis is the second best Cash Money album Ive ever heard next to Juveniles 400 Degreez which is definetely a 5 Star cd too The Hot Boys put out an album with like 5 or 6 really strong songs And as bunch of other average or a little better songs Not really any horrible songs at all The Best Songs are the main 4 I Need A Hot Girl We On Fire Respect My Mind Tuesday Thursday Those 4 songs were the songs I listened to every morning for like months and months And i have over 200 cds So this cd must be good huh Ridin is another real tight one Then the other songs all blend in with the rest like Clear Tha Set by LilWayne Ya Dig by Juvenile Help by BG and Bout Whatever by Turk I Think its cool that all of them got there own solo songs Too Hot is nice tooalong with the rest of the songs Juvenile BG Turk LilWayne put out one of the best cds of 99 and also the best group cd to come out for a long whileIts real good"

"2","Short book explaining Love and LogicAt first I was disappointed that this wasnt a longer book but then I realized that it is great to give away to curious friends and parents as an introduction to Love and Logic I just wish it was a little cheaper"
"2","Book reviewThis is a book for all parents or parents to be all people thinking of having children Love and Logic is a program to help you be a more effect parent raising responsible children It can also be used on co workers and the rest"
"2","A Novel as Enjoyable as the Restaurant AntoinesIf youve ever eaten at the wonderful restaurant Antoines in the French Quarter of New Orleans with its many themed Mardi Gras private rooms you will definitely enjoy this book And even if you havent eaten at Antoines if youre interested in New Orleans society midway through the 20th Century youll find this a delightful mysteryIn addition the home of the late author Frances Parkinson Keyes is open to the public in New Orleans Its actually called the Beauregard Keyes House after Confederate General Beauregard who stayed there and Frances Parkinson Keyes And the author also wrote a novel about the house called Madame Castels Lodger which is filled with the interesting history of General Beauregard Phyllis Zimbler Miller"

"2","Fantastic Advanced CourseMany parts of this book are difficult to understand for the beginning and intermediate user It is an informative advanced reference the only one needed for an experienced website creator There are no color examples of what the HTML language produces making some of it difficult to piece together if you are not experienced"
"2","Simply excellent No ComparisionI am a system analyst with IBM background client server is totally new for me and being a novice in this area I found this book of immense help The topics have been beautifully explained HTML XML CSSDHTML are no longer nightmares for me I must say that from day one itself I started writing HTMLs This book is simply great for anybody who would like to learn about HTML I would recommend this books to beginners as well as experts for reference The book is worth buying This is worth 5 star rating"
"1","Complete reference yesWell although i found the book to be extremely informative and I learned a great deal from it I was very disapointed that I could not get a lot of the examples to work for me I am not talking about the images but the actual pages did not come up the way the way the book depicts them if you type them in exactly the way it is printed I had to tweek them a bit to make them work correctly I fell that I am going to have to go elsewhere to find the right type of book for me Other than that the book did have a lot of information to give and will keep it as a reference as the books title plainly details"

"2","Why Some People ComplainThe thing that most people dont understand about the FFVI sound track is that it couldnt possibly sound the same as the game When people buy it they are expecting the exact same music and they heard while playing it but it just wouldnt be done On the original SNES system that this game was made for it had a very poor sound quality system in it It was only about 16 bits if even that much Nobody would want to listen to the poor quality music that the game produced when they could hear it orchestrated and remastered like the future FF Series games had All in all i thought that this sound track was an excellent portrayal of the way the music should have sounded had the game been placed on a CD based system instead of a 16 bit SNES cartridge system"

"2","gliderthe glider got here much sooner than I thought it arrived in great shape and all the pieces were there I put it together by myself even if the kept saying 2 people It was not hard and directions were simple Its really nice"
"1","benchThe bench is very nice I had a few pieces that looked like they were painted over scratches and some of the metal were scratched I was unsure of some of the screws as you can not tighten it too much or is strips the plastic wasnt sure on the indents on the metal bars which way they were suppose to go on the bench broke after sitting on it three times The glider bar broke the weld is not very good or sturdy"
"2","Great GliderWe needed to replace a wooden glider that we had in front of our house and after looking around and not really finding what we were looking for our son suggested we check Amazoncom We chose this one because we felt it would last for a long time and the size was right When we received it we put it together and it was very easy to assemble The movement of the glider is smooth The color is a little blah but we added a couple of colorful pillows and have received many compliments on it The price is great and we are very happy with our purchase"
"1","Gauges in chair armsChair is the product ordered however it came with gauges in the arms The chair was well packed and the damage appeared to have happened at the factory before wrapping for shipment Poor quality control Not worth returning the product Other than that the bench is substantial and as promised I have pictures taken while I was unwrapping but couldnt figure out how to include them"
"2","Very nice gliderGood quality and fairly easy to assemble although it helps to have 2 people It is quite comfortable and looks nice"
"2","Fantastic glider benchRight after I clicked the purchase button for this I remember wondering what the heck I was doing buying a glider bench off the internet It was so reasonably priced compared to the ones I had checked out in stores I figured I was getting some flimsy poorly made item But this bench is awesome My husband put it together in about 30 minutes by himself and its sturdy but light enough that I can drag it around our backyard to catch the sun or not It has held up to all the wet weather weve had its easy to clean and glides beautifully It really is a quality product Im thinking of buying a second one for our patio"
"2","James Moody takes San Diego Beyond the BorderJames Moody and his well known cast of characters have put together an awsome sample of what can be done when you think everything else has already been done I really enjoy listening to this up and coming jazz artist because he has a style that is all his own I play this CD everytime I am trying to impress someoneand it never fails to do the job There are some really great songs in new styles that consistantly perk up my friends ears when they hear it They know that song but theyve never heard it played like THAT before"
"1","Seal IVI am a huge fan of Seals first 3 albums so I rushed out to buy this one the minute it came out What a disappointment Most of the songs sound like old remixes of Curtis Mayfield tunes The only 2 with that eerie signature Seal sound are heavenly and tinsel town Id say go to Ituneslisten to the songsbuy the tunes you like if there are any and call it a day"
"2","Woburn Forgotten Tales Untold StoriesI purchased this book hoping to find some history of the town that one of my ancestors Samuel Richardson helped found Although there was little mention of people from my direct line this was an extremely interesting read of the history after the town was founded in 1630 The history and characters are real and the various chapter authors did an excellent job of researching facts and putting them into facinating stories This book gave me a better understanding of what several generations went through in order to make Woburn what it is today This would be a great read for anyone interested in the early history of the United States"
"1","Too Much on the Mystical PlateThe idea behind God was in this Place and I i did not know it is excellent Take the famous line from Jacob at Bethel and see how it has been interpreted throughout the ages by various Jewish worthies In the process have them talk to Jacob in a kind of free form midrash unshackled by time And since the writer is Rabbi Lawrence Kushner add a bit a personal reflection and home grown storiesAll the elements are here but the book never gets off the ground In juggling so many elements in so short a space Kushner gets lost and the book lacks a real sense of forward momentum or thrust This would have been a good idea for two maybe even three books Kushner would have then allowed himself the luxury of exploring some of the very good themes he has laid down here and not fully explored"
"2","Gods ZooWonderful video very comical and loved by kids also teaches some good Biblical truths and good gospel songs"
"2","DifferentThe average work about socialism talks about such dry topics as economics and politics This essay doesnt do any of that It goes into art and even pseudopsychology one could say It covers a broad variety of topics in a short amount of pages I agree with almost everything said in this book Its definitely worth reading and will really make you think"
"2","AwesomeThis is probably the best essay I have ever read It has defined my political reviews still today Its a work of true romanticism"
"2","An interesting little essayAlthough the title is the soul of man under socialism the theoretical basis for what he talks about would be more of a collective anarchy commune which fosters his individualism more than the socialisms that we have seen in theory and practice in the last couple of centuriesThis is an interesting little essay because of its meandering nature it starts out as a political tract then veers into a brief on aesthetics and then tries to synthesize the two at the end For me its process felt unsuccessful but at least there are many places that can be quotableQuotable to the point that I wanted to in a halfhearted daydream to imagine using this text as a theoretical basis to look at Wildes own creative work to see if he meets his own aesthetic standards While that project may not be worthwhile the reading of this essay is worthwhile"
"2","Great Actors Well done filmShah Rukh Khan is my favorite actor I enjoy seeing Rani Mukerji paired with him This film was well done It showed some of the difficulties couples might face after marriage One thing that stood out to me which bothered me was that the inlaws of Ranis character seemed prejudiced against Shah Rukh Khans character I believe that once a family member has married someone the rest of the family should be respectful and supportive of that choice and welcome and love the new spouse Most romantic films focus on the relationship up until marriage with the idea that the couple will live Happily Ever After However the reality is that relationships need to be cared for after marriage And this film gives a glimpse into the reality of marriage"
"2","Great movie not so great DVDThis is one of my favorite bollywood movies If youre a fan of Shahrukh Khan or Rani Mukerji youll love this movie Its interesting too in that it goes beyond the usual pretty love story Where a lot of movies consist of boy meets girl boy woos girl boy and girl get married this movies looks at the question of then what I know some people have complained about the bickering in the second half but I didnt think it was that excessive The movie just portrays the usual silly arguments and misunderstandings that couples faceId give the movie five stars but this particular product gets only 4 stars for the DVD quality Its definitely pixilated in parts not the best quality picture Still watchable and I wouldnt return it but wish the picture was a bit better"

"1","Grrrrr ArrrrghWe few we lucky few who must endure the Praxis II Practices of Learning Teaching Test will find no guide hereThere is a brief discussion of the structure of the test and some sample questions yes but the content of the test is not discussed at all outside the sample question I would have loved to see a literature or concept review such as is found in almost every other test guide on the planetAlso it seems the PRAXIS II went from a fiveresponse to a fourresponse test at some point and the authors responded by chopping answer E off all the sample questions without checking whether or not that was the correct answer In other words they revised the questions but did not revise the answers Most frustratingIn all I found this book a sorry excuse for a test guide and recommend it for nothing except mulching or perhaps kindling"

"2","Bass voice delight in jazz musicMiss Jordan always had a special attitude for the bass the bass lines she uses to play with singing in a group As much as Anita ODay used to do whith drums Sheila Jordan has the unique ability to express herself in a clear witty and unique way scatting or singin words talking and exchanging suggestions with the acoustic bass player This is the second according to my knowledge and probably one of the very best of her duo recordings A must for jazz fans and listeners keen to jazz singers with an instrumental attitude"
"2","Danelectro DJ20C Rocky Road Spin Speaker Mini Effects PedalThis pedal is cheaply made but it sounds terrific makes even a cheap organ sound half decentIt really does give you that Leslie effect if you mess around with the settings a littleIt smells of burnt rubber as it is cheaply made but apart from that I would highlyrecommend it for a keyboard but not much use for a guitar really The price is good forwhat you get as with all Danelectro effect pedals I received mine through Jax Music Supply LLCwho were great to deal with for a fast and reliable service"
"2","FabulousThis book was awesome A fast paced riveting novel by an author I am coming to find just CANNOT disappoint me I am hooked on her Carpathians and now find that I will run just as fast to the bookstore when her next gothic comes outTHE SCARLETTI CURSE is a terrific love story and mystery set in a supposedly cursed castle that has everything from grinning gargoyles to an impressive maze The hero and heroine are just as riveting in their fascinatin for each other and then their entanglement in the mystery of THE SCARLETTI CURSE I highly recommend this book to all readers Feehan fan or not But be warned by the time you turn the last page of this book you will be hooked on Christine Feehan"
"2","SHE HAS DONE IT AGAINOH MYOH MYSHE HAS DONE IT AGAINTO THE ONES THAT HAVE MSFEEHANS OTHER BOOKS YOU NEED NO INTDUCTION TO HER FINE WORKTO THE ONES THAT DONT KNOW ABOUT HER DARK SERIES THIS IS A GOOD BOOK TO GET TO KNOW ABOUT MSFEEHAN WORKNICOTETTA AND GIOVANNI STORY IS SO POWERFULTHAT YOU DONT WANT THIS BOOK TO ENDONLY LOVE AND MAGIC COULD KEEP THEM AT EACH OTHER SIDEA KEEPER 4 STARS"
"2","WonderfulWonderful book Very few fans of Feehans Dark series seem to realize that although this book is not part of the Dark series is the children and childrens children of this couple will tie in to the Dark series later Bryons lifemate will come from this line But if you want to learn about whats going to happen in the future books in this series as well as the Dark series then go to Feehans web page You can use any search engine to get to it But this book really is wonderful It can really stand on its own I cant wait for more from this author The publishing company needs to publish her stuff quicker than this Cant wait till Dariuss story Dark Fire Feel free for anyone to email with any questions Ill sell you on these books"
"2","A change from the Carpathian SeriesThe heroine Nicoletta is the village healer Overlord Don Giovanni exercises his right to select a village girl as his bride and chooses Nicoletta against her wishes His home the Palazzio is a foreboding place mysterious and frightening to the villagersa place with a history of death Giovanni is able to communicate with Nicoletta mind to mindthe only similarity to the Dark Series Heroesbringing a subtle sensuality to their burgeoning relationshipa welcome change from the pounce on each other in the first chapter genre Feehan continues to bring us dark heroes and independant heroines who find love in the sharing of each others gifts"
"2","RivetingI have really enjoyed Ms Feehans Dark series so was eager to read her new book This is a true gothic with just enough paranormal elements to help build a relationship between the hero and heroine Nicoletta has special gifts which her entire village tries to keep a secret however it is the presence of these gifts which draws Don Scarletti to her He has gifts of his own Nicoletta isnt immediately enchanted with the idea of marriage to the Don Unlike some authors who use the I hate you temper tantrum to ignite passion between the main characters Ms Feehan uses the empathy and sensitivity of her characters to achieve it The love scenes are wonderful though not very plentiful So if youre looking for the same amount and intensity of love scenes as in the Dark books you may be dissappointed I read this in one sitting and couldnt put it down The story is riveting"
"1","Not her bestBefore I begin let me just say that I absolutely love her Dark series Those books are great This one had potential but it just fell flat Her characters simply werent developed enough this time for me to relate to them This effort was decent but not at all up to her usual standards"
"1","This one is missing that Feehan SparkThis book was a major disappointment It was missing that special spark that made Ms Feehans other novels especially Dark Desire something special I found the book had very little action little romance and a mystery plot that was never very mysterious or suspenseful This is definitely not a book that I will pass on to my friends and family to read"
"2","Intriguing storyWhile I dont consider it the best of Ms Feehans books that I have read The Scarletti Curse is an intriguing story that is very solid The protaganists are believable and interesting If you like Ms Feehans books I can recommend this one as an addition to your library"
"2","amazingI Loved this book Heart pounding romance and action keep you going though the whole storie I say this is a Must Read"
"1","Too BoringThis book had great potential that it did not live up to I hope she goes back to writing more Dark Series books This book needed more action and more editing it was way too long for the amount of plot it had"
"1","Ick ack Put it backI absolutely couldnt stand this bookIm not understanding how its sexy for a woman to give up her friends and life for a guy who wishes to control her completely The Don was a jerk Nicoletta is an awesome heroine in the beginning but turns into a submissive wifey thing by the end Its a sad thing when a woman to paraphrase an actually part of Nicolettas thoughts leaves her old life behind because hell never like it and because she just HAS to EeeeewI loved the Dark series and constantly used to stalk the bookstore waiting for the next one This one was the beginning of the end of my love for Ms Feehans work I bought it to tide me over from one Dark book to the next and it made me so angry that I wrote the author and got into a big argument over the bookPlease please pleaseread something in the Dark series or Emma Hollys Upyr series Youll be a lot happier"
"1","disappointedi was really disappointed with this book The other ones that she has wrote were very good but this one was dull it was as if she rushed to put a new book out and didnt take the time to make it interesting i would still read other books that she writes but i wouldnt read this one again"
"1","Not up to scratchI first found Christine Feehans work through Dark Prince It was an excellent read and has had me hooked on the whole series I thought this book would be the same not even close The Scarlatti Curse is humdrum Before I reached halfway I really didnt care about the characters The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional I also did not get a feeling for the period or the place In short it seemed like a short story plot that was enlarged to take advantage of her success with the Carpathian series Please Christine dont write any more like this"
"2","WONDERFUL GOTHICIm not a gothic reader but i bought this book because im a big fan of Christine FeehanI enjoyed this book very muchit had alot of suspense paranormal and of course romance The plot was greati got hooked from the begining My only question was it did not reveal how the Scarletti brothers got their gift Christine Feehan did an excellent job and im looking forward for her next bookwell done"
"2","YOU HAVE ANOTHER WINNER CONGRATULATIONSCHRISTINE HAS DONE IT AGAIN THIS BOOK IS AS GOOD AS HER DARK SERIES WITH JUST ANOUGH SUPERNATURAL ELEMENT TO SPARK THE INTEREST OF THOSE PARANORMAL ROMANCE LOVERS IN HER USUAL STYLE THE CHARACTERS ARE IMMOTIONALY BOUND AND KEEP YOU READING ON AND ON IN ONE SITTING WITH A CLIMATIC ENDING THIS BOOKS KEEPS YOU QUESSING RIGHT TILL THE ENDTRUE GOTHIC WITH CREEPY HOME WEIRD RELATIVES AND ODD SERVANTS I LOVED IT AND WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT GOTHIC OR ANY OF HER DARK SERIES FOR THAT MATTER WELL DONE"
"2","An Old World change thats definitely wonderfulThe Scarletti Curse is absolutely wonderful Ms Feehan once again created a lively well written work that stand far apart from her Dark series which I also adore With complex and dark characters this book has quite a lot of bite and more than enough romance for a true fan of Christines work I highly recommend this book for one and all"
"2","Great ReadingChristine Feehan does it again for all of you that have only read this one book by her i strongly suggest that you read them all"
"1","I really wish i hadnt wasted my timeFirst let me say Id heard that I might find the Dark Series of Christine Feehans my cup of tea and for some unknown reason thought this was one in the series no need to tell you I was severely disappointed and confusedThis book really reminded me of the romances my Mother used to read back in the 70s blech Lots of dark male broodiness all written from the heroines point of view and of course shes a young innocent virginedited to add I really wish I had only given this one star but it appears I cant change that now"
"1","Couldnt finish itI really like Christine Feehan This book was very dissapointing The plot had promise Nicoletta was a sweet heroine The prose were good and the medival Italy setting was an interesting change of pace However the plot flows like molasses in January I managed to get half way through before I through the book down and went back to the Dark series"
"1","Poor supportIve had the camcorder for a while now and was hoping to be able to use the USB streaming feature to make small computer movies and send them to my friends and family overseas Although the camcorder is good the included software is weak and the USB streaming makes a very choppy poor quality AVI file I recently got a new computer and could not find the device driver disk that came with the camcorder Sony technical support was a joke and they ended up trying to sell me a driver for my camcorder So now I have a camcorder that I can plug into my TV or record onto a VHS Do people still use VHS but any dreams I have of putting something on my computer are fading fast Im going to have to find a new way to send my parents the video I took of my new houseFrankly in this day and age an analogue camcorder is a waste of money"
"2","Very GoodJust as promised worked well for what I needed I have some old 8mm tapes and needed a camcorder to play them back on and this fit the bill it also had the USB streaming so I can now transfer them to dvd also the shipping was quick and package great for protection"
"2","Great for the moneyThe picture on this camera is good and it needs very little light However the colors are not quite as accurate as I had hoped for Hi8 Perhaps digital would have been better but the price was a factor I shopped around and found Amazon had the best price available"
"1","Low resolution and poor qualityI bought it new in 2002 for 400 The color is pretty good The resolution is very poor only close shot get you satified Other than that you get blur edge and barrel distortion sometimes I didnt use it a lot for the first 3 years only the last 2 years I used it regularly to tape my daughters piano class homework every 2 weeks for 58 minutes each time Recently I have to knock this camera extremly hard several times to make the recording start Its common issue as the piano teacher told me So I have to find a new camcorder now I dont know what can I do if it refuses to work one day in my daughters piano class"
"2","Better than some out thereMy oneyearold has played with this toy for several months He disregards the keys and pulls up on the lids themselves Not quite what I expected Hes had more fun pulling the lids up and pushing them down again and only accidentally happens upon the moving keys and the noises they make The sounds alternate between giggles with music background and animal noises also not quite what I expected But its noise I can deal with The volume can be adjusted or turned off through I myself cant distinguish between soft and loud on this thing My son enjoys the toy but it may be of limited or intermittent interest"
"2","Fun toyMy 11 month old son received this for Christmas and he loves it He loves to watch the animals pop up and make noises Its fun to watch his face light up and hear him squeel with delight when he hits one of the buttons and the animal pops up"
"2","Cruel and UnusualCruel and Unusual is the first Patricia Cornwell book I have got read and I for one loved it and I cant wait the read more of her books my boyfriend told me about Patricia Cornwell books he said I need to read Hornets Nest and Southern Cross and those will be my next two book I will be reading and I will be reading them on my new IPad I got for Christmas I cant wait keep up the great writing Patricia and thanks to my boyfriend for telling me about this awesome writerRKsbabydoll"
"2","Good Deal and Fast ShippingI bought this book used and it was in very good condition Also I received it within a week which was nice"
"1","23 of a great book then blahI listened to the audio version of Cruel Unusual on a recent trip to New Jersey and back The first 23 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat then the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment After all the buildup the who of the whodunnit ends up being nobody in particular And the fate of the evildoer Nothin much Disappointing Wont bother with Dr Scarpetta or Ms Cornwall againIm a little baffled by all the reviews that say great book bad ending and still give it 3 stars or more Isnt a mystery DEFINED by the ending by how the author ties up all the loose ends and red herrings"
"2","ReviewThis book was a bit more difficult to follow in my opinion I was lost toward the end But Patrica is an awesome writer Im sure the problem was me not her writing"
"2","Love ScarpettaYou have to love the Scarpetta series by Cornwell This is an excellent story full of suspense and humor"
"1","A really bad bookHere is a summary of my impressions1 It was written for about the 6th grade level2 There was virtually no grab for the first 23 of the book I simply trudged through That is highly unusual for a crime book3 The author went into excruciating detail about extraneous subject matters This happened multiple times Youll feel as though she was just trying to fill pages4 But most of all there was no closure to the story in any satisfying way That is paramount in a good crime bookIn summary dont bother If you do youll be asking the same thing I did I want my 10 hours back that I wasted on this bookHarris LevinCruel and Unusual A Kay Scarpetta Novel"
"1","formula type writingMy first foray into this writer was her latest book Scarpetta I enjoyed itso I purchased this effort and several others she had written I was a bit disheartened to find that all of her books have basically the same formula and character studies After a while reading her work becomes less than stimulating It becomes trite"
"1","Just Plain Cruel Will DoI must say I was required to read this book for a class If that had not been the case I would have put the book down half way through it I was put off by the excessive amounts of technical language and graphic descriptions of the state of murder victims Quite frankly I was very disappointed by this book"
"2","Cruel and UnusualA typical Patricia Cornwell fiction novel easy to read and a page turner It gripped me until the end Enjoy"
"1","I guess it was a mysteryIn a word Lacking Her style of writing left me unable to appreciate the underlying story which as a result I found rather vacuous and inauthentic So much so that I felt compelled to come write a review of this book so others might avoid making the same mistake I did No offence Patricia"
"1","Inproper AdvertisingI needed to replace a lost CD set of the library CD book Cruel and Unusual by Patricia Cornwell The one I ordered from Amazon was listed as a CD set not as a cassette set so I ordered it I received a Cassette set of the book and NOT a CD set of the book I wrote through Amazon to the seller and their reply was that I received a CD setThe Librarians can vouch for what I received as I showed them the envelope and the contents within it Even though it was my responsibility to replace the CD book so I wouldnt have to pay the Library charge I now had to give that job to the library Need I say moreThis time and its the first time Amazon has a very disgruntled customerThanks for asking for the review Maybe Amazon could check into this and prevent others from experiencing what I experiencedSincerelySherry BohmPS Yes my husband and I are still Amazon shoppers Were just going to have to be more careful now"
"2","Solid Addition to the SeriesLike the ones before this book is a solid forensic and police procedural A death row inmate is executed and his fingerprint later shows up in a current crime scene How could that have happened I particularly enjoyed seeing Kays niece Lucy again as she is 17 now and her own person no longer a child Lucys computer skills continue to amaze I look forward to reading the next in the seriesNote There is a continuing bad guy introduced in this book who appears in the next two installments as well Id recommend reading this book before The Body Farm and From Potters Field"
"2","Still Loving ScarpettaI could not give this book a full 5 starts For whatever reason the book seemed to bogdown and I just wanted it to end I will continue to read the series but this one was not my favorite"
"2","GreatWell paced novel with interesting characters and plenty of plot twists Patricia Cornwell writes characters that are real and have depth Her mastery of criminal science is wonderful and offers a sense of authenticity that few authors achieve"
"2","Another one doneVery very goodI can usually figure out who did it not this time so many complicated twists and turns Great read"
"2","Cruel and UnusualThe book was excellent I was barely able to put it down I love the Kay Scarpetta series and am excited when I get to read more"
"1","Muddled ending disapointsThe good The basic plot line is interesting a man who has just been killed by the electric chair has his finger print turn up at a murder scene The writing itself is good The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well fleshed outThe bad Other characters are not well fleshed out The plot never fully explains itself Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes or is it about Scarpetta redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her after developing an antisocial workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one The latter seems to be the path the author choose leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain on many different levels as a family member as a friend and as a professional in the end her goodness is redeemed How the bad guys in the story turn out seems to be unimportant which I found to be a major flaw"
"2","SpellboundThis was my first Patricia Cornwell novel and I must say I was blown away I never thought Id warm up to a modern mystery writer the way I did with Agatha Christie and Dorothy L Sayers but Ms Cornwell has displaced them both in my heartC E was by far the most fascinating book Ive ever read I sat up until the wee hours of the morning reading this wonderful novel devouring every word as I couldnt go to bed until I had finished it The only disappointment was the ending The killer came out of the blue and there were too many loose endsThe story and characters were first rate and I intend to read all her other books Its been a long time since I found an author I would be willing to pay hardcover prices to read"
"2","Very nice bookI really liked this book It is a page turner for sure I would read before I went to bed and have to force myself to find a stopping pointI think that Patricia Cornwell is at her prime in this novel"
"1","Too scattered too shallowAlthough this might be a good book to introduce issues in technical writing to someone considering the field it is not useful if you want anything more than a broad overview The information it contains varies widely in depth and is sometimes dated for example there are several paragraphs discussing the features of dotmatrix printers but only one short and incomplete list of the types of bindings available for professionally printed documentation For some unclear reason two sections on editing are separated by 10 pages on usability testing If you are actually involved in technical writing there are better books"
"1","Soooooooooooo NOT FunnyThis movie was not only NOT funny but it was excruciatingly boring I think Adam was channeling the Aristocrats Whilst Aristocrats was not as funny as it thought itself to be it was still better than this garbage"
"1","Totally UnfunnyWhen the film first started playing my partner and I looked at each other as if to say What on earth is this but we decided to give it a chance and let it play for about half an hour before we couldnt bare to watch any more The title says Funny it wasnt The overall cover is totally misleading and gives you the impression it is a funny film by someone who had previously done a funny film but it was in no way funny at all The jokes were terrible the script was terrible Very disappointing"
"1","Nasty People Nasty FilmEntertaining in places but spoilt by lots of crudeness and dirty talk that degrades woman In the end I found nothing memorable or funny about this film Sad for Adam to seem him in such a trashy film"
"1","zero starthose guys ARE OVERATED ARE THEY REALLY FUNNY NOPE STUDIOS PAY THEM MILLIONS OF DLSS FOR THIS CMON AMERICA WAKE UP"
"1","DramedyThis movie was perhaps Adam Sandlers worst effort He seemed tasked with the burden of playing a man who was apathetic but he came across as being apathetic about the role The result was that his performance never engaged viewers to want to pull for him which made the climax of the film lackluster It was occasionally funny considering the title and cast of comedians who played comedians The last 45 minutes the film changes pace entirely as if it wasnt floundering enough and drops its attempts at weak comedy to push even weaker drama Despite all the big names and cameo appearances the only real stand out was Leslie Mann who plays Sandlers ex She was the only lively force in the cast but sadly alone she wasnt enough to bring it back into focus Youre not missing a thing"
"1","The Not so Funny PeopleI love Leslie Mann and Eric Bana but this is probably one of the worst movies Ive ever seen It was like 3 or 4 movieplotsstories put together and just kept climaxing then letting down then rising action again and climax and letting down over and over I just kept wondering when it was going to end I should have walked out like so many others didSome may like but its NOT my cup of tea"
"1","What happend SandlerHis movies seem to be going down hill The only thing i found funny about this movie was Eminem snapping in it Other then that it is just not that funny Dont let it trick you only see this if its free"
"2","serious comedyFUNNY PEOPLE is somewhat compelling and engaging film about a comic with a terminal illness that almost kills him and destroys his lifestyle and how he fights it and comesback to enjoy lifehis friends and a beautifull woman he meets"
"1","Long somewhat dull and unfocusedThis is not a typical Adam Sandler movie which is not necessarily a bad thing but it kind of is here First of all its not funny Its about comedy but I wouldnt consider the movie itself to be a comedy although there are a few funny things in it I suppose This movie seems like its all over the place It has a long runtime but it doesnt really accomplish much Some people might like the story but it was pretty dull to me"
"1","WHICH JOKE DID YOU FIND FUNNYAdam Sadler plays an unlikable comedian George Simmons who finds out he may be terminal with AML and tries an experimental drug He decides to do stand up again when he meets comedian wannabe Ira Wright Seth Rogen attempting standup Sadler is impressed by Ira and hires him to write jokes and to be his personal gofer Ira finds out about the illness and convinces George to tell his family and friends about it George plays the death card to patch up relationships then suddenly he isnt going to die anymore George reexamines his life but even at midlife he is still an immature ahole Everyone has sex but Ira which seems to be a sad jokeI found the jokes and humor to be at best lame The language was crude and sexual Brief nudity Perhaps what is best about the movie is that it makes sitcoms look really lame If you think a guy saying tweet over and over again spinning around in a circle is funny then this movie is for you"
"2","Far better than its reputation and well worth a lookIntelligent funny sad real with a terrific dramatic performance by Adam SandlerFor a lot of its length I thought it would be a truly great film but some clunky almostsitcom plot turns in the last 14 a little too much length and notquitethere supportingperformances in key roles hold it back and keep it a very good movie not a great oneNonetheless far better than the often cold response in got in most of the mainstream press"
"1","Starts out with promise but then goes downhillToo bad Adam Sandler could not have been given a better script Funny People starts with promise as a Jim Carrey Man on the Moon type film and then drifts oddly into some sort of romantic comedy with repetitive ck jokes There are two movies here made from what seems like two first drafts Maybe it is a marketing problem Or maybe just lazy writing Sandler does a great job showing off the dark side of a comedian Maybe Funny People would have been better as a straight drama"
"1","Not so Funny peopleWow I usually like Adam Sandler Judd ApatowSeth Rogen films but this one came and left the theaters before I could get a chance to see it I dont think I laughed once during the entire movie Not even a chuckle It seems as if no one was having any fun making this film The unnecessary over the top crudeness of Apatows ensemble doesnt seem to work with Sandlers schtick I loved Knocked Up and 40 Year Old Virgin but there doesnt seem to bee much chemistry with this group I was waiting for Bruno to show up and throw in some more unnecessary genital conversation I almost bought this Im so glad I only rented it"
"1","Obviously not Adam Sandlers bestAn acceptable movie with some good moments by Adam Sandler and some of the other new American comedy guys but very far from his really funny people involved movies like ANGER MANAGEMENT with Jack Nicholson or the hilarious LITTLE NICKY"
"1","Not what I expectedI seriously did not expect a dramatic look into the mind of a comedian when I rented this movie They marketed this movie like the Forty Year Old Virigin and Knocked Up When I rented the movie I expected a lot of humour and with so many funny actors I put way too much faith in it My wife and I was so disappointed that we stopped watching it I dont watch a lot of TV but when I do watch something I want it to be worth whileIf youre into these artsy films about the serious life of people in the spotlight then youre going to like this film However if youre looking for humour like Adam Sandlers previous films ie Happy Gilmore etc then you can forget about itI give this film 1 star because this is not my kind of movie and it was advertised like a great comedy film not drama film"
"1","Couldnt give it less than one staror i wouldveNot much to say about this moviei am a huge Adam Sandler fan and i love him in anythingbut this movie was looooong and booooring The comedy skits in the movie werent funnyat alli guess if you enjoy hearing about masturbatingcocksand fartingyou would like it Like i said not much to sayi paid to watch it on my Suddenlink Direct Demand and i wish i could have my 399 back"
"1","Absolutely NOTHING Funny This is one of the worst movies I have seen The dialogue is awful There is ZERO humor All the characters are boring and completely humorlessWhat a loser movie"
"1","Worst movie Ive ever seenThis movie was HORRIBLE I dont know how anyone could give it 5 stars This movie was the worst 2 hours of my life I expected more out of an Adam Sandler movie I felt like I was watching 2 movies at once Any time someone asks me about this movie I tell them its a waste and to rent something else"
"1","worst film everI saw this movie with my friend a couple of days ago i said to her this is real stupid i could stop watching it right now and i could care less about the ending She said we saw this movie already and she is telling me what happens next so we start getting into an argument she claims WE saw it and i said Vat i am getting alzheimersFinally we figured it out we started to watch this movie together about 3 months ago and i lost interest and i zonked outadam sandler and all the whos who in jewish comedy were funny in other movies but this one really eats the birdskip it"
"1","The L O N G E S T movie EVERAnything with Adam Sandler in it is supposed to be funny This however just well wasnt I really do believe that this movie had potential but there was so much going on so many stories within the story that they could have made 3 movies out of itIts 2 and a half hours long Thats about an hour and a half too long for the main story plot This movie honestly seemed longer than Titanic or Gone With The Wind because it is so long and drawn outThere is very little humor in Funny People The only good thing about it is all the major stars that pop up here and there which is probably why in my opinion at least that this movie even made it to the big screen and didnt go straight to DVD"
"1","profanity the movie or profanity and the degeneratesi cannot believe that an intelligent actor like adam sandler would degrade himself by acting in a degenerate trailer trash movie like thisbut i guess money makes some people do things that are beneath them this movie is as funny as a sewer all it is comprised of is endless and pointless profanityvirtually ever second word the writer who has very little if not any intelligents has substituted profanity for lack of intelligent writingis the endless profanity suppose to make the male lead charactors appear more manly yes it is true that quentin tarantino movies has there fair share of profanity however his movies use of profanity is justified as it is incorporated with intelligent writing if you have very little or no intelligents or are a degenerate and trailer trash this movie will appeal to you"
"1","Seth Kept this movie from getting a ZERO star ratingA truly great example of how terrible some movies have become Vulgar Offensive Unnessisary nudity I usually love Adam Sandler and cant believe hed stoop so low in this role Seth is highly likeable in this but still swears and lowers himself as well The woman who plays Adams romantic interest is mostly great but also stoops to swearing blantant sexuality The writing is the worst in this movie This awful movie is 2 hours and 22 minutes long but only feels like 5 hours And I could have spent my life doing something more interesting and exciting like watching paint dry or grass grow I suggest skipping this movie altogether Tragic where movies have gone to Much has been lostScott MacNeil comedian"
"1","StupidHonestly if you don want to hear a lot of swearing you wont like this Let alone the story line was ridiculous Wouldnt recommend"
"1","Sandlers worstI normally love Sandlers movies but this was just horrible None of it flowed right jokes were horrible vand stupid and just all around made no sense Dont waste your time and money on this"
"1","Not goodThe movie skips a few scene transitions and once it got to chapter 15 I couldnt watch any of the rest of the movie at all and the file online said it was like new The disc itself looks clean but it will not play at all in my 2 week old player and three other players I tried it in"
"2","GIFTI bought this for a Christmas present for my son It arrived in perfect condition He loves Adam Sandler and collects all his movies"
"1","waste of timeI must say I never liked Adam Sandler There were so many more talented people who just never got a chance to be on the screen I still dont get whats with Adam SandlerBesides that I decided to give it a shot It took half hour when I stopped watching"
"1","Depressing then becomes boringmy husband and I watched this and ended up watching something else this will be a waste of your time"
"1","Please just run far FAR away from this filmIt is wayyyyyyyy too long and completely aimless Some may call it complex but I call it crap There are a few little laughs here and there but nothing that would make this worth sitting through Even when one steps away from the fact that this was not intended to just be a comedy and rather attempts to tackle some more serious contentit still sucks Dont waste your money Watch I love you man or Grandmas Boy or something that is actually entertaining I wish someone had warned me"
"1","THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADEJudd Apatow has reached an absolutely new level of sucking Even Adam Sandler one of my favorite actors of all times sucked too big time There are funny movies there are not so funny ones there are stupid and ridiculous flix and theres Funny People Its name should be changed to whats the word for utterly unfunny Almost 100 of jewish actors and they couldnt pull it off Thats odd"
"1","MoronHow can anybody even smile with the kind of garbage Adam Sandler ALWAYS performsThis guy is just a moronic retardDO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON HIM"
"1","NOT FUNNYThis is what Hollywood is calling humor these days Must of been written by the lowly out of work writers during their strike Crude demeaning and a waste of my time"
"1","Pretty pathetic peopleThe new stars of comedy make me miss the real ones Why dont you try to learn from thy elders like Mel Brooks boysSide note Hollywood hasnt come up with real comedy since Meet the Spartans Anybody who forgot how brilliant it was needs to watch again I Will Survive at the end of the Spartans it might still be on Youtube SidgzLnhW4"
"2","great movie movie is longer than 2hoursthis is a great movie its not 40yr old virgin funny or knocked up funny but its a pretty good movie alot of famous ppl in it has alot of good funny parts 2 it the only reason i think its not really funny is because theres none of those funny parts like knocked up of the 40yr old virgin has dont pay attention to the reviews rent the movie or something if u like it buy it"
"2","Not entirely a comedyI am big fan of Judd Apatows work i went into this hearing that its not like his other movies that it has a more somber serious tone so my expectations were tempered I liked it i do agree with some other reviewers that it was probably a little too long which is why I take off one star But if you go in knowing this isnt a 40 year old virginknocked up style comedy then you wont be disappointed with that being said i can see why some people rated this poorly if thats what they thought they were going to see going in"
"1","Winning Cast movie fell shortThis movie was not an original concept The jokes were lame as were the performances The writer and director disappointed the audience by using Adam Sandler Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill as a box office draw When in fact it wasnt worth the money to see this film in a theatre"
"1","ACTUALLY NO STARS for rating pf Funny People movieSave your money Your time can be MUCH better spent This was one of the worse movies I ever sat through Actually I drifted away close to the end and was thankful I didnt waste that time Its AWFUL"
"1","Not Funny PeopleNot worth the timePros there were several good oneliners introduced me to new comediansCons excess foul language adultry"
"2","Very inspirationalSo I just watched Funny People For a movie that has an all star cast it was a great movie If you want to see a movie filled with laughs and a good story pick this movie up I promise you wont regret it"
"2","Sfars BestA delightfully funny story A wonderful graphic novel that gives us a catseye view of the Sephardic Jewish community in Algeria and then the Algerian community in Paris in the early 20th Century Its a love story Very funny and endearing And the hero is a cat This is a must for Joann Sfar fans"
"2","The Rabbis Cat is the cats meowThis book came highly recommended to me by my Rabbis husband I was not disappointed I think everyone will love this illustrated novelJorma"
"2","A wonderful funnysad bookThe Rabbis Cat is a wonderful book I heard the author speak on NPR and got the book The book is in the form of a comic strip each box lovingly illustrated by the author The pictures are wonderful particularly of the cat They are a joy to beholdEven better are the stories anecdotes taken from the lives of the Jews in North Africa in the thirties The stories are both very sad and hysterically funny The cat has a sardonic turn of phrase that had me in stitches Through the difficult medium of comics the author has managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and place Much of the book is given to musings about life philosophy love God and so on If you like a good discussion youll enjoy this bookAlthough the books can be enjoyed by nonJews I think if you dont know the basics of Judaism youll be missing the most vital part of the book Of course the book is so appropriate for the cat lover The author clearly understands cats perfectly"
"2","good artwork tooThe review with all the details about the depth and levels of the story hits the mark so I wont repeat it However I will emphasize what was not commented on The Author is a very talented artist He takes risks on many pages and it works resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying I hope there is a book to follow I really enjoyed the characters and how they delt with their world and their beliefs"
"2","Delightful exotic world seen through a cats eyesThe Rabbis Cat by French artist and filmmaker Joann Sfar is a whimsical charming fable featuring a rabbi his lovely daughter and a host of other characters headed by a talking cat Both protagonist and narrator the cat often acts as a Greek chorus who comments often sardonically on the actions of the humans around him Set in preWorld War II Algeria with a lengthy detour to Paris the beautifully illustrated narrative depicts a richly diverse world in which individuals seek to preserve their traditions while constantly interacting with people of other cultural social and religious backgrounds In this multilayered environment the presence of an intelligent talking cat does not seem entirely out of place"
"1","SelfServing MessageThis is the tale of a kindly Rabbi his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her The tale seems promising at first until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws The cat represents the glorification of sin itself and delights whenever the books characters fall into ungodly habits judging them forever as hypocrites taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi thus giving the tale a happy ending In short The Rabbis Cat is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their selfserving do as you feel lifestylesOne more note This book despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover is definitely not appropriate for children"
"1","Not what it looks like on the coverAs someone who is interested in different cultures I thought the book would be an interesting window into other peoples thoughts Instead I open it to find a swearing cat he uses the F word denigrating religion and showing religious people as hypocrites in a lame stereotypical way Might be interesting to others but its not interesting to me Not only is it not suitable to children but there are a lot of adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either I wish I had been warned before I tried to read this book"
"2","The Last dissenting WitnessThe way Bill Sloan wrote Jean Hills side of her story of the assassination was in perfect terms Jean Hill was the closest person to President Kennedy when the shots were fired and she saw where the shots came from and the feds tried to cover everything up I believe that Jean Hill really knew and saw what happened that day in November Anyone who would like to find out information about the assassination I believe this is the right book to read and hear what was truly covered up"
"1","See my article Jean Hill The Lady in Red onlineSince writing my review of JFK THE LAST DISSENTING WITNESS in 1998 I have been able to have my 35page article Jean Hill The Lady in Red included in Clint Bradfords JFK Assassination website The address is httpwwwjfkinfocomsitemap1htm scroll down for title"
"1","DrivelJean Hills story changed with the wind She saw next to nothing during the assassination but used her unique location and her active imaginationto keep herself in the limelight for years It got so bad that even the conspiracy writers were shying away from her toward the end It was laughableSomeone needed to ask her about the little dog she said was sitting in the car with JFK and Jackie Look at the original interviews she actually said itThis book is BS from stem to stern Go read a fairy tale at least theres a moral at the end The only thing you find at the end of this book is your wallet a little lighter"
"1","An Ever expanding story followed by same ol same olVery disappointing read Starts with her tale of what she saw in 1963 then devolves into another MASSIVE GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY work Offering no documentation to support statements made Unsupported statements about what her boyfriend said claimed or saw Lauds Garrison and his persecution of an innocent man in New Orleans Originally I thought 65533The Assassination tapes65533 By George O65533Toole was the worst effort in Conspiracy volumes but no more"
"1","Uneducated NonsenseThe physics department at my school gets the mad ramblings of this man and I usually end up with them seeing as how no one else will read them In a word I sum these writings as nonsense Most of his ideas aside from being mostly incoherant and physically absurd also defy the timetested and true concepts that the average highschool physics student could debunk Furthermore mixed in with these insane babblings are religious and political ramblings which he tries to pass off as the only possible truthMy recommendation unless you want a good laugh or evidence of the undereducation of many Americans pass on this book Any other use of your money would be a better one"

"2","Good valueI love Curve and this is a large bottle which make is a very good value Highly recommended"
"1","Unsatisfying ending disappoints the readerThe plot develops nicely then ends abruptly with an unsatisfying ending It seems to the reader as if the author had reached her contractual page limit and slapped an ending onto the book A superhuman villian was terminated too easily The method of capture was not adequately developed Several promising themes were not followed up by the author especially the entriquing possibility that through genetic testing Gaults uncle may have been his father or the reason for the military being interested in the investigation The author took one of the least interesting possibilites and handled it in a below average formulaic manner"
"2","The Best Patricia Cornwells bookI have read all Patricia Cornwells book and I think Ms Cornwell has reached her best in writing this bookSuspense mystery New York they all contribute to keep you awake until you finish the book"
"1","Kay Scarpetti is losing itHere is a character I have enjoyed develop But Kay is losing it She should dump her niece Lucie clean up her personal life its not nice to have an affair with a friends husband and treat Det Marino with some respectAs for Gault if I pick up another Scarpetti book with his name in it right back on the shelf"
"1","If you cant say anything niceWell thats no fun Honesty is the best policy right This was the first of Patricias books I had the displeasure to become acquainted with Ive tried reading another of her works but I cant get over the simplistic writing with unnecessary adjectives thrown in for no apparent reason except perhaps to make the sentences longer and make the reader suffer from the protracted tripe More than that this book failed to make me care about the characters or about the outcome of the story"
"2","Great readThis book is a great read a lot of fun Id recommend it to anyone who likes the genre On the down side I think that Gault is a little too evil he borders on the implausible with his ability to be one step ahead of the game Also I think Cornwell needs to develop Dr Kay a bit more shes a good character but needs more depth"
"1","You have GOT to be kiddingThis could be the worst novel I have ever read It is also the first and last Patricia Cornwell novel I will ever read There are so many problems with this book that they cannot be listed here so here are but three points 1 The main character Kay Scarpetta is an insufferable humorless snob Id never before read a novel where I hated the main character Great job Pat 2 About 90 of the novel is dialogue Very bad dialogue But this is understandable since Cornwell cannot write prose 3 The story is predictable and boring and the ending is utterly ridiculous Im astonished that this book was ever published let alone made the bestseller lists"
"1","My brain froze overThis supposed thriller is mindnumbingly dull and inept I had to give up half way through"
"1","Losing her edgeI loved Patricia Cornwells first five novels sadly her sixth loses its edge I wanted to enjoy it but the plot labors on and I had a hard time finishing a book I couldnt wait to read We lose Scarpettas forensic grit and instead focus on a bizarre rather boring computer plot I hope the next books in the series are better"
"1","The devil in the detailIm not a fan of the crime writing genre so I require more than some blood and guts and a few nasty frights to make me speak highly of a crime novel Unfortunately I cannot speak highly of From Potters FieldI know more about dogs than I do about forensic medicine so it makes me suspicious of the novels factual integrity when I read that a murderers eyes are as pale blue as a malamutes when in fact according to the Alaskan Malamute Club of America a malamutes eyes MUST be brown never blueIt also made me laugh to think that all the crime agencies and the media in the USA would be completely ignorant regarding the closest relatives of the countrys highest profile serial killer Although if the good guys had known some basic details about the killers family tree Dr Kay would have been left twiddling her thumbs so I suppose I should quit complainingWell I read the book right through to the end and it kept me amused so I have to give it one star"
"1","The pits a contrived potboiler Avoid itIf you love meaningless running around plot lines thatdefy even sympathetic attempts to suspend disbelief andsnarled bureacratic conflicts among different law enforcement agencies you might put up with this one Otherwise the book disappoints One gets the impression that it was written in haste A pale imitation of the previous work deserves to be piled high on the remainder tables if not in a Potters Field for books"
"1","So far the worst book of one of my favorite authorsHaving read all of Patricia Cornwells books I was very disappointed about her latest achievment Draging the villain through 3 separate books probably wasnt her best idea Even more disturbing The characters of her main heros Scarpetta Marino Lucie were described inconsistent with her previous books"
"1","Very DissapointingFrom Potters Field is one Patricia Cornwells worst book she has written Its not the characters nope Its not the writing that is wrong Its the story that makes the book disappointingTemple Gault has struck again This time we know this for sure Both the readers and Kay Scarpetta do Someone from Lucys past is also back The problem with this book is that Gault is not a strong enough villain to carry this book He is not scary or very threatening Its not exiting Partly because we never get into his head we are always inside Scarpettas Even if Cornwell did venture inside his head Im not sure if it would be that exiting For a killer on the loose plot its very weak of coarse the forensics are very good and original But for the most part a very disappointing Scarpetta novel"
"2","Intelligently written a fast and suspenseful readI am on my 8th Scarpetta story I most enjoy the relationships Cornwell developsMarinos gruff demeanor and language are so colorfulDr Kay is a strong female figure who uses her brain to handle the men who would take her downThe development of Lucys character is interesting but it is time she too develop into a stronger person emotionally Cornwells work is for me as good as Grishams"
"1","What a disappointmentI expected better than this poorly contrived story of murder and mystery from a wellseasoned author The plot line lacked substance and the ending was poorly executed The only reason I continued reading the story was in hopes that it would improve as I read Boy was I disappointed"
"1","Just awfulThis was possibly the worst book I have ever read I am amazed by the number of fans for this kind of rubbish"
"1","A wildly implausible thrillerThis book is so unrealistic that it spoils all the fun super killers like Temple Gault a clone for the Satan Incarnate known as Hannibal Lecter are more silly than super I found all the other character two dimensional and all the intrigue regarding super computers insulting to my intelligence Has Cornwell done better I dont know and after reading this am in no big hurry to find out"
"2","From Potters field buried with no nameChristmas is always a notoriously bad time for Kay Scarpetta Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia and consulting forensic pathologist for the FBI When Temple Gault a cunning serial killer whose killing spree began in Richmond several years earlier resurfaces in New York with the murder of a female transient left in frozen Central Park Scarpetta jumps head first into the investigation The identity of the homeless woman becomes top priority and when it is discovered who she is the investigation is spun into a radical new direction Meanwhile Gault has set his sights on Scarpetta herselfleading to one final terrifying encounter in the fetid tunnels below the cityA fascinating book with wonderful characterization grisly accuracy and a highvoltage suspensful ending The Scarpetta series is the best When it comes to crime fiction no one does it better than Cornwell"
"1","Impressive delivery but plot lacking in believabilityThis was the first Patricia Cornwell book I have read She is a compelling storyteller and she obviously possesses great knowledge of the subject matter I do admit to finishing the book in a twoday period but it was more to get to the inevitable final showdown between Scarpetta and the killer Scarpetta and some of her cronies are characterized well but the killer seemed a bit stereotypical I dont believe in reading ahead and spoiling the surprise but in this case I skipped some detailed sections to find out how the killer would be stopped in his tracksSince reading this book I have read Cause of Death by Cornwell and would rate that book slightly higher than this one This book is not her best that Ive read so far but it wouldnt prevent me from reading another oneThis is a good focused and knowledgable writer who does not need to fall back on unbelievable killers and sensantional plot devices to tell an imaginative story"
"1","No one will edit this because Im Patricia CornwellAt least thats how I felt about this book which seems only to have been published because the author has written some truly interesting previous novels I recommend the first three books in the series I cannot recommend this book for anything except kindling However not having a fireplace I filed this under G"
"1","a let downThis books just didnt do it for me I enjoy PC but this book Seemed too easy Things just happend people just called In fact I think this books had some bad editing I felt as though all what was needed was there and that someone just yanked out the big sections for no reasonI am still a fan but this one is a skipperThe doc just happens to see the resturante that the killer was usingThe polices offer in charge is left in the subway with two people who are not police Just does not at add"
"1","To contrived and therefore not plausibleI found this plot to be to contrived in that many of the scenes were just to clearly made up for me to become vicariously involved The twists and turns in the plot were simply to convenient for me to appreciate a sense of natural flow that good novels must have For example The scene in which Gault the killer has been seen using the same restaurant that the main character spontaneously finds herself in Imagine in New York no less Not only that but the killer is using the main characters visa in the same restaurant And then the genius software engineer niece who just happens to be working on a huge computer program in the law enforcement field Im sorry but this tale is just to unbelievable It might make a passable B grade film but I wouldnt want to see it"
"1","Stilted and HokeyThis book reads like the tin man in the Wizard of Oz walked BEFORE he was oiled Jerky and clumsy with a very hollow ring to it I read 13 of the book and threw it in the yard sale pile Its the first book of hers Ive read and I dont intend to pick up a second one This is really a prime example of bad writing churned out for nonreaders and quick profits"
"2","Terror in Central ParkHere is a terrifying novel by Cornwell Her knowledge of medicine and forensic science keeps you turning the page A womans body is found in the snow in Central Park There is no question that the killer is one Temple Brooks Goult Scarpetta discovers that his killings are a pattern with one ending It is one of her best By Ruth Thompson author of The Bluegrass Dream"
"2","Patricia Cornwell rocks Best mystery writer on recordLike all of her Scarpetta mystery novels Patricia Cornwell has proven again that she must have been one dynamite of a Coroner when she was practicing She has a wealth of information in her books and it is so interesting to follow as she progresses to solving the mystery Ive never enjoyed reading as much as when I pick up a Cornwell novel"

"1","Worst English dub of a great TV seriesThis suckedThe WORST English dub EVERCrayon Shinchan is long TV series that lasted close to 12 years in Japan Funimation did NOT purchase the entire series just a handful of episodes so you dont see how the stories and characters developed and changed over the many seasonsThe English dub they made changed the entire dialogue and Americanized practically ALL the characters and situations to an extreme low brow humor Granted the original show did have a lot of puns and low brow humor as well but Shinchan did retain an innocence for his mischief being the focus that he was always this incredible force of fun shaped as a 5 year old boy True fans of the manga and series should NOT buy this lame production by Funimaiton"

"1","No theory what so everThe authors seem unaware of the fact that theory guides our understanding There are no objective facts yet the authors present all their findings as such with almost no reasoning attached This is both arrogant and ignorant The authors display no grasp of theoretical advances in Accounting and I recommend getting a book that has a better exposition of principles as more than practice"
"1","You sure can tell this was written by an accountantThere sure is some exciting literature out there This is not it The material is very drydesert comes to mind I am using this book for my accounting 211 course at OSU and boy is it fun note the sarcasm And whats with the dates in the example problems such as 1231x1 What is that Were they too afraid to put a 9 in there They didnt think we the students could handle it But hey Im not bitter or anything I dont even think you COULD make accounting interesting A must read HA"

"1","WorthlessHow this man has managed to write so many books while knowing nothing about 1 travel and 2 archaeology is a mystery to me First he shows up in Jordan with no local money on a Friday youd think someone passing themselves off as a knowledgeable traveller would have figured out banks in an Arab country are closed on the Muslim sabbath Then he continues on with a series of quack theories about aliens and technologically advanced ancient civilizations and harps that make rocks float There not even good quack theories like Hancock or Buval who while equally worthless at least make an attempt to back up their theories Read something else"
"2","Theres no other book like this oneThere is no other book on Africa or Arabia like this one Like in his other books Childress rambles from place to place looking for mysteries lost cities and adventure If you are looking for some dry fossil hunter story this isnt it Its the only book that I know of that covers such unusual topics as port cities in the middle of the Arabian Desert the history of the Ark of the Covenant the giant megaliths of the Kalahari Desert and other littlediscussed topics Lots of old maps photos and illustrations It is a fun book to browse through as well"
"1","Dont botherWhat a disappointment This book is about 50 selfcentered travelogue and 50 teasers about the mysteries I expected a book full of archeological information about cities and cultures that have long since disappeared but instead got embarrassingly ridiculous chitchat and superficial explanations I wanted scientific information not a book that tends to explain most of its mysteries via levitation and alien beings"

"2","Explains why economics and politics dont mixHazlitts view is simple economics can only be understood if we look at the effects on everyone over time He views most government economic tinkering as myopic focussing only on one group of people for a moment He shows how government interventionwell intentioned as it might bealways hurt people in general over the longterm including the people we mean to help He champions the forgotten manthe people who are hurt when the governmet tries to improve on the workings of the marketplace"
"2","a brilliant wellwritten economics primerHazlitt presents a clear concise lesson on basic economics His message is wellarticulated and wellsupported This is a must read for every person who has ever worked or voted or is planning to do either because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practiceUnfortunately there are some erroneous ideas in this book Hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy he also seems to think that capitalisms merit lies in its service to the common good However these fallacies are rare and they do not significantly detract from the bookFor a great backtoback lesson in economics and its moral base read this book followed by CAPITALISM THE UNKNOWN IDEAL by Ayn Rand"
"1","Dont waste your moneyIf you are new to Economics this is one book that you can skip It is not useful nor mandatory reading if you are looking to understand the subject better There is not even one chart or graph included in this book Stick with Naked Economics Undressing the Dismal Science or Economics for Dummies as these two titles will serve you better"
"1","More of a personal opinion than that of economicsWhen I read something I like the whole story with some facts to back them up but what I got out of this book was a guy with one side of politics while giving his opinion Although many of his policies I tend to agree with I just have a really hard time reading something when the entire book well I only got around a third way through it is swung in one way direction If you like reading about someones opinion then youll love this book but if youre like me and just like cold hard facts leaving it up to yourself at making your own opinion then dont buy this book"
"1","Not what it claims to BeI was actually looking for a book on economics This book is more of a conservative rant Its not so much that I disagree with what he says so much as the fact that its all politics and very little economics Buy this book if you want to hear how much the author thinks liberalism stinks not if you want Economics in one lesson I definitely feel like I got tricked into buying it"
"2","The best book on EconomicsI have ever readExcellent read for the layperson Most relevant to our current economic crisis in America Every politician should be required to read this book In fact every classroom teacher should read it as well Explains the mess our government has created and why its continued destructive policies are leading our country to assured economic collapse Policies based entirely on fallacies"

"1","NO HelpThis book did not help me with my economics class Even though I passed the course with a B This book reads more like a novel and really does not simplify economics at all I work better with definitions and examples and this book gives none"
"1","Polemic and OutdatedI read this in the 1980s and it was a nonevent back then Like most books that claim to have the answer this book gives an enormously oversimplified view of economics that does not reflect the real world Moreover it presents as settled many open questions claiming the authors opinions as facts There are many better books on freemarket economics and far far better books on economics in general"
"1","Too simplisticAlthough though were presumably members of the same political choir the author treats economics much too simplisticallyCalling this book a polemic on Keynesian economics would be accurate calling it an economics treatise would be just plain wrongTime would be better spent reading Bastiat"
"1","This aint no economics bookI was expecting a book on economics 101 so maybe I might understand market forces PE ratios stuff like thatIts just a big argument for a libertarian government Not even particularly good arguments either theyre all based on metaphors like the broken window paraphrased from memoryEven though they may get paid a community does not get rich fixing broken windows That holds the community still it does not push it forwardThats a fine argument and all but thats not teaching Metaphors are mental manipulation give me all the pros and cons and let me decide Or better give me the damn factsAnd its outdated too The book is 50 years old We are so NOT in Post WWII economics"
"1","No lessons learnedThis is one of the most disappointing purchases I have made on AmazonThe book is one long myopic libertarian apology"
"2","Best book on Economics for the general readerThis is an excellent introduction to Economics Hazlitt was a clear writer and his analysis of fallacious economic thought is very informative You dont have to be a student of Economics this is a book that can benefit every reader I just wish more of our politicians had read this book"
"2","If you dont have this get itThis book is a wonderful illustration of the simple so simple they go unnoticed principles of a market economy and the many fallacies of adding socialism to the mixI could have easily given this 45 stars but I didnt have the option The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 was that Hazlitt partially caves in about halfway through the book on the topic of unions Unions are tantamount to coersion and have no place in a market economy"
"2","Read the angry antiHazlitt reviews for a real indicationI think beyond the fact that Hazlitt produces a succinct and wellargued explanation for why free markets are the best arrangements in economic relationships what is really wonderful is reading the screeds of those readers that he pisses off Read the rabid ranting temper tantrum of the one reader who amazingly was accepted to the University of Chicago and you can see how ideas that actually support free thought and productive profitable endeavors drive lunatics like this crazy its awesome This dork probably marches against the WTO"
"2","Give this book to a your childrenEconomics in One Lesson elucidates the basic principles of Economics in a simple understandable language If you are just starting out on economics I would recommend this as your first book College Textbooks will bore you and treatise like Human Action by LW Mises are pretty hard for a beginnerAlso be sure to give this book to your children Schools dont teach economics a most important of subjectsWith that said I would like to comment on many 1 star reviews Notice how they dont comment on the content of the book Economics is a Science and it is better to put away your Political Glasses when studying it"
"2","ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSONEconomics in One Lesson is another great must read book Like Bastiats The Law it is short and sweet At the same time it clearly explains the basic fundamentals of economicsConsidering the stupid and abusive actions that are rampant in Congress state legislatures county commissions and city councils the overwhelming majority of these socalled leaders are utterly ignorantDont you be one of themBuy and read Economics in One LessonThen call up your politicians and give them an earful"
"2","Never more needed than todaySure a few of the specific examples cited 60 years ago are no longer relevant today but the basic lessons are absolutely and permanently valid and need more than ever to be understood by at least a majority of the voting publicThe sad fact is that Americans can go through the entire public school system and higher education without learning the first thing about economic science while getting bombarded with selfserving economic propaganda Thus public gullibility to the fallacies cited by Hazlitt seems no less pervasive now than back then while the resultant cancerous growth of government economic meddling has only increasedHeres a revolutionary fantasy Make this book a required study by all high school students Imagine what that would do for the kinds of politicians who get elected in the futureBTW you can get the nice hardcover edition at less cost directly from the Mises Institute"
"2","Economics even you will UnderstandFor all who avoided economics like the plague this is the book for youvery informative and gives the novice a good foundation of the subject Check it out next time you argue economics with uncle Fred you wont sound like such a dope"
"2","Simply brilliantThis is a great start to learning Austrian economics or rather any kind of economics All members of Congress should be required to read this before being allowed to vote on any bills Peter Schiffs Crashproof would be a great followup to reading Economics in One Lesson And for the more serious student of Austrian economics especially in these times you should read von Mises Theory of Money and Credit and Rothbards The Great Depression"
"2","One lesson that EVERYONE needs to learnAs a student and teacher of economics this book has proved to be an invaluable resource The lesson is simple and direct yet one that many people fail to apply This should be required reqding for anyone involved in the development of economic policy or any other arm of policy making for that matter Whether you agree with Hazlitts conclusions about how the market works or not you cannot dispute the key lesson of this book It is entertaining to read particularly easy for a book about economics I highly recommend it"

"2","Great BookVery easy to read simple arguments that destroy many fallacies in current political rhetoric I learned a lot from this book without feeling like I had to muddle through it I benefitted from taking micro and macro before reading but its not necessary and anyone interested in learning about how special interests kill the consumer and taxpayer because their wellbeing is easier to measure and is effected more immediately aka every modern economic issue has an obligation to read this book"
"1","PainfulI wouldnt recommend this book to an enemy True the information may be worthy but the writing style and the narration were horrible It is definitely NOT written nor read in a conversational manner Im willing to cut the narrator some slack as he was only reading what was written however better inflection phrasing pauses etc would have greatly helped this otherwise tedious bookI couldnt even finish it I suffered through the first 5 disks and after all that investment in time I couldnt bring myself to listen to the 6th Its just that poorly writtenIll restate the fact that the message the information is worth hearing its simply written in such a tedious manner that I couldnt stand to hear it through the endI think Ill donate it to my local library"
"1","Unsatisfactory and very outdatedI am in my 60s and thought it would be a good time to remedy what I perceived as a gap in my education economics I never had a course in economics and the only book I had read was Heilbroners Worldly Philosophers a satisfying but very general overview as I recall I probably read Heilbroner in the late 70sIm an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them I can only say that the book was dated full of economic events that were referenced from WWII and excessively polemical and rigidI read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250 I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book wasI think the book should be retitled Economics in One Polemic The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940s and the 1950s"
"1","Dont Be Fooled By the Title of This BookThe only economic lessons in it are a very biased critique of any economic policy other than capitalist doctrine I wanted to learn about economics and was so disappointed in this outdated onesided book"
"1","Hypocritical Biased outdated and misleadingThis book opens with the author explaining his objective analysis of popular fallacies within economics In no way is this book objective it is not so much a introduction to economics than a book with a political agenda He rarely shows two sides of the arguement spins fact real well all the while omitting valuable information contrary to his veiws DONT READ THIS AS YOUR FIRST ECONOMICS BOOK and if you do read it take it with a grain of salt"
"1","Capitalism straight in small unpalatable dosesIf you want your faith in market forces and low taxation reinforced this is a straightforward but blinkered attempt to make you forget all about government regulation Funny that westEuropean countries with bigger taxation and more government influence have less crime better education better health care better TV programmes than the US They also organise their politics better so that the tax money is better spent It did set me right on one or two points and parts are written in a spuriously funny way but it is too biased to be really informing Clearly the writer has never listened to people he doesnt agree withIf you have an open mind compare this dangerous nonsense with the writings of Naomi Klein to see how unfettered capitalism works out in practice"
"1","Rightlibertarian views presented as factThe problem I have with Hazlitts economics primer is that much of the information he presents as fact is nothing but rightlibertarian ideologyHazlitt attempts to explode liberal myths by taking out of context the social advances America has made in the last 70 years The author believes that unchecked corporate power will liberate the economy and therefore humanityHazlitt is obviously a corporate apologists who refuses to scrutinize the successes of liberalized trade policies throughout the world A look at any number of third world countries will reveal the true outcome of relinquishing government and social controls of the economy"
"1","ASTOUNDINGIt is astounding that anyone in this age can seriously recommend this book It has no bearing on the world economy and is blatantly anti labor and anti government regulation It is hopelessly out of date"
"1","how to fail economics 101This book preaches a very right wing kind of economics If you can imagine one of Rush Limbaughs readers or helpers writing a primer on economics then this is it Keep government small etc The author most likely was an Austrian school follower As it is avaiable free on Limewire maybe get a free copy on the Net or browse it in your local library No need to buy unless you want to flesh out sic the ideas of Mr Limbaugh et al The book relentlessly hammers home the ideas that government should be amall self interest drives the economy forward and that state intervention is bad"
"1","Read this if Youre Stupid and wish to be Fanatically StupidVery Stupid Once you enslave your mind to a blind fantasybased utopian distortion of capitalist society which has nothing to do with the actual functioning of that system on any level at anytime whatsoever and the top beneficiaries wouldnt have it any other way no matter what this economiclibertarian garbage espouse this is what comes out of your pencil Read this book turn off the real world and turn on to a reactionary and libertarianutopian rehash of greed plunder pillage and plutocracy WORSHIP touted as common sense"
"2","Back to basicsSometimes back to basics is the clearest path towards understanding current realities It is amazing to me that a book written in 1946 is still so fundamentally relevant"
"2","A great alternative perspectiveParticularly appropriate for these times even many decades after it was written Hazlitts Economics in One Lesson offers an alternative to the traditional Keynesian economic theory of the 20th Century This book is a fairly easy read for noneconomists and though a bit repetitive towards the end quite enlightening Id recommend this book strongly for any student of macro economics or anyone curious in what is happening to the global economy"
"2","Sanity in EconomicsThis is economic sanity Easy to understand If more people and especially those in government would read this book we would be better off"
"2","Fine SummaryThis is a great primer that should be read in all schools Hazlitt does not deal in economic details here Intead Economics in One Lesson covers more useful ground for the average person it cumulatively teaches us how to think logically about economic issues And of course how you think is the basis for what you think Even the casual reader will take away an ability to spot economic silliness many of which spring from the same bad premises the same elementary blindness to causeandeffect Economics in One Lesson provides the type of knowledge that stays with you for a lifetime"
"2","A good libertarian primerThis book is a little outdated and a little heavy on the libertarianism but otherwise its a very easy read and I particularly like some of the stories it uses to present basic economic ideas"
"2","ImportantJust under two hundred pages I learned more from this short book on Economics than from three entire textbooks in College Concise well worded and simplified reality Anyone wanting to understand the market system and how it works can gain greatly by reading Hazlitt"
"2","EconomicsVery clearly written with a minimum of jargon Basic principles easy to understand even for the noneconomist but topics were not oversimplified Essential reading for anyone who wants to make informed decisions in these troubled economic times"
"2","Frighteningly PropheticAn easy to understand overview of economics and when considering the condition we are in today scary It explains a great deal about our current economic problems though originally written in the 40s"
"2","Great bookThis is a great introduction to economic analysis It is very well written and the examples are still surprisingly currentBad economic thinking plagues the political and mediatic scene Hazlitt focuses his effort on a key mistake that of ignoring the unseen possibilities or opportunity cost"
"2","Great summary of some very difficult economic principlesThis was my first experience reading Hazlitt and it wont be my last He has an Adam Smith way of writing whether intentional or not whos to tell and everytime I wanted to compare this book to Wealth of Nations I quickly curbed my enthusiasm This is a good book not great and Im not quite sure why all the great reviews I do like his way of explaining some very difficult economic ideas and I can see this book being a valuable introduction to economic principles maybe not economics 101 In summary well worth your time to read but not a good enough book to truly fit its title"
"1","oversimplified diatribeWow this one is really out there Only Any Rand and Ron Paul who know nothing about economics could recommend this book For example consider these laughable claims that I paraphrase The primary problem with economics as practiced is that no thought is given to the long term consequences of policies to all groupsThere is no difference between supply and demandThe vast majority of economists are ignoramusesIt is all very simple listen to meIf you can believe this stuff read the book You can get it online for free"
"1","More politics less economincsI wish I had read more of the reviews to learn that this book is less about economics and more about pushing a particular political point of view The point of view is hard right and the current recession disproves most of the economic patter After skimming a few pages I threw it away I didnt even want it in the house"
"1","This books title is misleadingThis is propaganda not an economics lesson The book is full of faulty logic apparently spewed to promote a libertarian agenda I couldnt be less happy with this purchase"
"1","Seriously FlawedBottom line there are some serious flaws in the authors thinking For example in chapter 11 Tariffs the author argues that imposing a 5 tariff on an import sweaters from England ends up costing the US Never once does he add the 5 duty received into the equation How can someone argue against an import tax without analyzing what happens to the revenues from that tax When the next chapter stated that Exports must equal Imports I quit readingIn short I couldnt agree more with the author that all too often the analysis of costsbenefits focus is too narrow Yet in trying to expanding the analysis beyond the too narrow the authors analysis in fact is often too narrow"
"1","Not a primer way too politicalGoing to be brief here If you are looking for an introductory to economics begin your search elsewhere Hazlitt has an opinion and he presents it here I was looking for something that presents both sides of sticky issues but more importantly spends a great deal of time on the fundamentalsThis book fails in that respect Keep looking Samuelson Mankiw Malkiel"
"1","Straight to the trash canThrew this book right in the trash not even a chapter into it because I realized it is nothing but the same old recycled and obsolete rightwing drivel that weve been peppered with over and over and that took our country to the edge of a second Great Depression If you are a concerned American you should stay away from this book"

"1","Too much kidpop music for a dark animated movieI dont like the fact that there was so much kiddiepop music on the soundtrackwhere as the first second and third movies had a blend of rock techno hiphop andrap but this one had too much kid music for a movie that was for the most partdarkThe only song on this album that fit the mood of the movies was Lights Out by PODThat remix of the song is the only reason why I bought this albumNot recommended for the whole album just that one song"
"2","TMNT SoundtrackI love the songs on this CD Some of the songs make me want to run fast and punch stuff"

"1","not quite what I was expectingI originally bought one of Daniels previous albums the title had insomniac in it the previous album was mostly acoustic with melodic vocals I bought it for my wife she loved it Next year I purchased deflaboxe and the CD got thrown back at me This album was NOTHING like the previous album I had purchased for her so if you are like me and buying this album based on his previous work think again he took a completely different style with this album"
"2","Agressive Wild Experimental Honnest poetryIn this experimental album Bélanger shows his own dark hidden garden Obviously describing his fights against a depressive lifestyle and his deepest reflexions in his previous album Rver Mieux wich totally impressed me he comes back with an exclusive musical and lyrical style mostly expressing how he concieves life as a constant fight analogy boxe All songs bearing numbers instead of titles he lets listners use their intelligence imagination in order to feel the music his own wayOne of the most impressive album from Quebec this yearI give 5 stars and two thumbs up"
"1","Nineteen folktales of South and Central AmericaThis childrens book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American childrens literature I am oviously in the minority with my opinion I only awarded the book two stars I simply found it boring But this is obviously a good resource of South American folktales Perhaps those who enjoy such material will like the book more than I"
"1","This book is incomprehensibleThis book was an anthology of 19 stories I didnt like it because it was hard for me to make a mental picture in my head I had to read almost every paragraph over I could not comprehend at all"
"1","It wasnt very goodThis book was about witches and possession I do not believe in those things I am a Christian I did not like this book very much at all I dont think this is a good book for kids to be reading because they might have nightmares Some of the stories are hard to comprehend But if you do like those kind of things you will enjoy this book Thank you for reading my review"
"1","Very boringI agree with the reviewer who is not the author This is really a bad book Totally not believable with no depth to the characters I find it hard to believe this book is so popular overseas I should consider writing for a living I think the author is a little touchy too I guess it was too much for her that someone didnt like her boring book"
"1","on orderI just ordered this fudge It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite Cant wait"
"2","Long torso but great productReceived this product in the mail and have worn it a few times Its fairly comfortable for a bustiercorset style waist cincher The boning is very supportive and higher quality then a bridal style corsette most of those are cheap and just to get things to lay down more smoothly Im pleased with the product One thing I will say on the negative side is that Im rather short These are more of a onesize fits all from what I understand and mine is a bit long in the torso since Im 51 Not an issue its meant that way so that it will cover under the chest down to about the belt so you dont have any random tire hanging over your pants but Im already fairly thin and this just causing the top wires to rub under my bra or jeans Not the best for sitting whereas a custom corset or one with a smaller torso likely wouldnt do that The cloth is fairly comfortable and does as promised"
"2","Love This ItemI have four squeem shapewear items and i love them all I do suggest finding your correct size not the size you think you are The terry cloth lining absorbs all wetness and i do see a difference in my shape It flattens your middle so your blouses tshirts and dresses look much nicer"
"2","Had some problems at first but now i love itI received my Squeem 1 month ago and was super excited when i first wore it but then the bone started sticking into my back right under my bra line it wasnt very comfortable not like when i tried it in the store and the top kept rolling over giving me the appearance of more rolls in the back This was definaitely NOT the look i was going for LOL Luckily i decided to dtop in the store where i first saw tried it and spoke to one of the clerks who told me i had to pull it all the was down till it was halfway covering my butt hips EUREKA What a difference this made now im loving it and hardly leave home without it I originally bought the XL nude now im getting ready to purchase the black vest in a L Great product my only complaint is that the bones could be firmer"
"2","Good choice for getting a vintage lookI have the nude version of this chincher in smallI favour a vintage pinup look every day so the small waist is a main focus I do have vintage styled cinchers and other authentic shapewear but they are expensive This is a perfect substitute for day to day wearAs said in annother review you cannot wear this under clingy slinky clothes as it does ripple up at the frontI would recomend wearing a slip under it to avoid skin irritation I wear a corset liner available from waist training specialistsThe length is fine on me going from just below the bra line down to the hip bones I am 5ft 4The cinching effect takes about 15 2 inches off my waist comfortably enough to get into my vintage diorI do not wear it enough to comment on the claims of permenant inch lossbut I think I will give it a try"
"2","Squeem works wellI am pleased with this item It would be helpful if it were slightly longer for my torso but everyone is different of courseI wear it a lot and it has held up well It is rubbery so a base layer is important or you may break out when your body perspires"
"1","Too small NO RETURNSI received this in the mail and followed the measurements on the site to get my sizewhen it arrived I could not fasten it as it was too smallAND THERE IS NO REFUNDSo I didnt wear it or use itand I am out 3500 plusfor the privilege of not getting the product I asked forone I could wear and usewill not buy from this seller again"
"2","wowthis product does exactly what it says it does the only issue is the first time you put it on it is pretty difficult to put on the hook and eyes are stiff but once you do it a couple times it becomes much easier Dont give up it is worth it"
"2","GreatI enjoyed this waist cincher it corrects my posture and makes me look slimmerHowever I think it stretched out a bit Or I lost some inches"
"1","Wasnt what I expectedI ordered the item according to the chart that was associated with the size and it ended up being to big The item is also like it is made from rubber but because I needed it for this weekend I dont know what I am going to do at this point"
"2","greatprovides great support and slims me down by 2 inches when I wear it I ordered a size small The size chart is very accurate it fits like a glove"
"2","a good smootherI do believe this product is very good but in my case the cincher smooths my waistline more than anything I am already petite so the cincher doesnt significantly reduce my waistline It does however make my waist look A LOT smoother and hourglass like You cannot really wear it under thin clothing as others have pointed out and for me it is impossible to wear it during hot summer days the sweating and the rubber can create a rash situation but I still recommend the product It is a very good and very cool cincher I think it can even be worn on top of clothing for a goth or fetish look It is wellmade and makes clothes look better on you"
"2","Works WellI bought this item for my wedding dress I wanted to make sure that I tried out the cincher before my big day and it works really well I started out with this same item in a Small but it gave me back fat which I do not normally haveI returned the Small and opted for the Medium and it works like a charm When wearing the cincher you have two size options with the double hook closurewhich allows you to let it out more around the bust tighter around your natural waist to create a better shape It definately does the trick and is made of rubber materialdef makes you sweatybut it DOESNT move around Totally worth itKinda painfulthe boning pushes into my underside boob probably because I am not super skinny immediately under my boobssize 36 DDLadies if it helpsI am 52 135lbs busty not super skinny but not fatsize 27 in jeans"
"2","squeem cincherLove this I had been looking in I dont know how long for this kind of product Ive had 2 babies so far and havent found a product like this I had an idea of what I wanted which was kinda like a coursette but without all the wires showing or nothing rolling up I came across this squeem cincher and had my doubts but Ive had it for a week already I ordered all 3 black beige waist cincher and beige body shaper that has strapsand Ive already got used to wearing it everyday its pretty comfortable and best of all it gives you a nice shape and flat belly look I love it now Im just hoping it will help me in losing some inces from my waist Ive read that it can last up to over a year so deffinitly worth the money Would recommend this to everyone"
"1","not really worth itI wore this for my wedding since I hadnt lost all of my pregnancy weight It was great for a little bit But then started getting a crease around my waist I cant wear it anymore Plus it made me feel very sick if I wore it for more than a couple hours They suggest wearing it 8 hours I couldnt do it As soon as I take it off I am instantly better"
"2","Great product great sellerI got this item within a few days of my purchase It is exactly what I wanted I look a whole size smaller instantly I tried on the Squeem in a boutique and fell in love but they were asking almost 200 for it I highly recommend this item and the seller"
"1","Painful ExperienceI think the concept is great but with this particular product they have these sections that are thicker rubber or whatever the material is and it literally pushed into my ribs every time I sit down I commute a lot and have a desk job so its not a very pleasant experience to have that pushing and bruising your rubs every day It wouldve been nice except for those thicker lines of rubber that arent very flexible"
"2","Great ProductItem was delivered quickly and it looks just like the picture It is a great item because it does not roll up when you sit down Ive been looking for one like this for a while and would recommend it to anyone Of course you must use it long term to reshape your body but it is worth the money"
"1","poor fitAfter trying three different sizesI still couldnt find one that fit I first ordered a medium and it wouldnt even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over pricedthere is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper"
"1","Not recommendedWhen I received this not only was it way too small for me the first and only thing I noticed was the horrible smell that came out of the packaging It was unbearable sort of like a burnt rubber smell Theres no way I would recommend this to anyone There are definitely other products on the market that do the job"
"1","Gave me a waist but just pushed my fat aroundThe product did what it was supposed to which was to give me a waist but it kind of just redistributed my fat My waist was super tiny but above and below mostly below I bulged like crazy so I ended up just looking really oddly proportioned My husband thought that I looked a little like an arthropod so definitely not the sexy curvy lady that I wanted to be I guess this product worked for other ladies but for me it just looked really unnatural and odd"
"1","Advertized as New but arrives worn outPlease note that I ordered three of these items as gifts and was surprised to see that only one arrived in its original packaging with plastic cover and without any signs of it being worn The other two had no plastic cover and had obvious streaks on the material All three were advertized as New on Amazon site Before you decide to buy new item beware that you may be receiving item that someone else has returned so please inspect for any signs of item being worn if fabric is stretched or not in its original plastic cover These items should be advertized correctly and not sold as New"
"2","Great results with some side effectsI have one of those spare tire waists but when I put this on I had an hourglass shape Ive never had results like this with any other shapewear But it does come with some side effectsWore it to work for 8 hours took it off to find that my skin was a grayish color im black and had lines which turned to bruises on my sides and lower back where it folded from sitting I did like the way it gave me a much trimmer waistline so the next day I wore a camisole under it and it was very comfortable That experience did however give me more incentive to exercise and get fit so I dont have to depend on anything to make me look trimmer"
"2","Perfect for getting rid of pesky love handlesTypically I wear a medium adult womens sized shirt and a large in juniors and I have pesky love handles thanks to my 2 beautiful babies This really works well too sucks you together and gives you that lift and confidence you wantneedThe one thing that makes it not have 5 stars is that after a while it starts to bunch up in the middle if you have some curve to you and Im not sure how to get it stretched out againHowever overall if it didnt bunch up I would give it 5 stars"
"1","UpsetIve been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years I purchased a new one recently and its not the same type of material of the previous ones ive brought I thought maybe because i had lost weight so i brought a smaller sizer but that one didnt fit the same either I thought i found a miracle when i first purchased the girldle through Amazon but i have found my recent purchase has surely let me down"
"1","Falling apartWhen I first received this product I was plenty happy I thought I had finally after 8 years of switching from cincher to cincher found the right one It squeezed my belly enough that it actually got me to rightsized eating whereas a lot of times I would get seconds I found when I wore this cincher I could only eat one serving which of course is wonderful I didnt mind that sometimes it bunched up I didnt mind that sometimes it left welts that went away shortly after I removed the cincher however after about two weeks on of the metal prongs came out making the cincher essentially useless because it doesnt hold its form Even the cheap cinchers at Walmart held up better than this and cost only a fraction of what this cost"
"2","ahiI am 116 lbs but after 4 kids a set of twins the tummy was not the same squeem gives me a beautiful shape under my clothesnever look better the only downfall it does not cut inches off or make you loose any body fatafter its off all the bulge comes out It makes you look great thoudont leave home without it"
"1","Incrediby difficult to put onWith the type of closures and the amount of compression it is meant to give its really difficult to put on You need a hand to pull it closed in order to actually be able to close each of the 20 some odd hooks"
"1","SqueemI ordered according to the size chart for my measurements and it was way to small Very uncomfortableI returned it"
"2","A bit uncomfortableI had to exchange the size but the small is still really small It gives me a nice shape but I should probably be wearing a medium I am a size 6 with a belly left over from a 25 pound weight loss Its tedious to put on and Im exhausted when I finally get that last hook hooked There has to be an easier way The back support you get is awesome but sitting in it can get uncomfortable after a while I recommend wearing it over a light weight tank of some kind The material used irritated my skin a little bit and it made me sweat a little Should you buy it If you are tolerant of the ins and outs then go for it It was inexpensive"
"2","This is the oneIm fairly tall and this could go on someone taller then me with no problem I love that you cant see it under clothes I notice my back feel better with it on my posture improves and I look good in my clothes I love this"
"2","really love itDoes the job and I feel the tightness Thanks for making a change that is a big difference for me I would recommed others to buy it"
"2","WowAll and all this is a very nice product It really holds in those unwanted mid life bulges and it looks smooth under your clothing It sort of helps your posture when sitting at a computer for very long hours The inner cotton lining feels nice against the skin and it appears to move moisturealthough not totally away from your skin Now mind you it is pure rubber yes I said rubber so make sure you wash it thoroughly also it will take two days to air dryI brought one with straps and bought the strapless one from Amazonmuch cheaper than a boutiqueCher"
"1","Not the shape I was going forI have ordered the Squeem on three different occasions trying a large medium and small as my size changed after having twins Unfortunately I was disapointed every time and I returned it after trying it on I dont know why I kept trying aside from desperation It just gave me a very weird shape Sure it cinched in my waist at the sides but what I needed was to flatten my muffin top I basically felt as if it squeezed my waist in and pushed all my excess down into the lower half of my torso making my muffin top even worse Im giving the product the benefit of the doubt with two stars thinking maybe its just my body type that is the problem I have a long torso at 510 and 140lbs Great product in concept but didnt work at all for me"
"1","BonesThis product does suck you in Great But the bones in here tore back back up I had all kinds of bruising when I took this off after wearing it all day they need to make one smooth with out the bones"
"2","MagicAfter 3 c sections I need all the help I can get I started with the size Large when I was a size 12 I have moved on to the medium I am between 810 now The medium is REALLY tight but does the job I prefer the large day to day because I have 3 children under 6 to run after and it is a bit more comfortable for that These things are really great I cant believe I didnt know about them after my first 2 c sections They should send all women home with them after giving birth"
"1","Wrong item shippedI ordered this waist cincher specifically to wear on my wedding day with my beautiful sleeveless dress Unfortunately they shipped the WRONG thing and now I am stuck with a big bulky and hideous vest It has very ugly racerback straps and I will definitely not be able to wear this under my dress And the worst part Im out the money I cant even return it for a refund even though I havent opened the box VERY disappointed in this company Buyer beware"
"1","Sizing is RidiculousI measure as a Small and the Small and Medium did NOT fit Update I ordered a Large and wore it for 2 days and it stretched too much I am not sure this will help but I have worn the item so I cannot return the Large I am not any smaller than when I began so the Large did stretch and did not shrink my waist andor hips"
"1","So what is the sizingI ordered a 3X because thats the size that the website said to order it came and lacked about 8 inches closingso I looked at the package and it says I should have ordered a 5xseemed extreme but I exchanged itI was very impressed with the speed of the exchange Ill say thatHowever when the 5X arrived its so big it just gaps and falls off So was the 3X mislabeled or is this 5x mislabeled Im needing something with some firm support for post surgery careso I really dont know what to do at this point"
"1","Causes sweat that makes it unwearableThis corset makes me Sweat like a hog I am not Im a petite woman just looking for structure to maintain a flat stomach Theres no doubt it gave me a fantastic shape was flawlessly discreet under my clothes but I was forced to stop wearing it because by the end of the day it was very uncomfortable hot and sweaty underneath This was bad for my skin too it made it dry and would have gotten red and irritated if I kept wearing it and for longer periods It got to the point where it was pointless to wear because the was no breathing for my skin underneath it and Id want to take it off immediately so I never wore it and just gave up and returned it Still looking for a perfect corset this however is NOT it Dont waste your time"
"2","best money I ever spent on shape wearI received mine today and I squeeled with delight when I heard the door bell ringing for delivery I immediately put it on It does take some muscle powerbut no where as hard as I was expecting to get it on It sucks tucks and hold My SO was giving me the side eyehe didnt get my excitement this was just another one of my many purchases BUT But ladies and gentlemen for the man who is looking to buy a gift their lady will love when I started trying on my dresses he exclaimed WOW it does take off a few inches of the waistI love it I have been walking around the apartment in it and I have been sitting and standing with no problems Well it does force you to sit upright Which is greatsmall waist and fabulous postureI cant complain I am loving my squeem"
"2","works greatBought it 3 months after pregnancy with twins I had gone down to my prepregnancy weight but my tummy was still not firm Used the belt and reduced the waist to prepregnancy size after wearing it 8 times"
"1","Great at firstnot so good over timePerhaps I got a bad one A factory second For the first 34 days I wore mine it was great just as advertised helped me fit into those pants that are just a tiny bit too snug around the waist I was very happy and it helped me concentrate on my posture too although it was very difficult to turn in the car seat when backing out of a parking space However I put it on today and while my left side is all smooth and nicely held in the support thing bone or whatever under my right breast seems to have lost all its firmness My entire right front is pushing outwards on that making a vertical bulge whereas my left side is still firm and compressed I dont know what could be happening"
"2","Recommend thisI used this product 19 years ago after my pregancy while working out and getting back to shape I had a slimmer waist within weeks You tend to sweat and lose inches having this on It is a bit uncomfortable at first and it takes getting used to but I would wear it only while working out Otherwise I would take it off19 years later after having my second child I was looking for the same waist cincher which I just received and began working out with it I am a firm believer this will bring my waist to where I was prior being pregnant with my workouts It is well made and sturdy The metal hooks never pinch nor they unhook while doing exercising I recommend this product"
"1","boning is not a plusIt holds things together but the boning gets uncomfortable would have been better without it It also folds in with the fold of my stomach which I didnt want so it doesnt get that pooch area as well as I wouldve liked I guess if you just want to tuck things in to wear a dress this would be good thats about it"
"1","PassThe Sizes run really small It flips up even though they said it would not and the hooks dont hold I am very dissapointed"
"2","Love thisIm training my waist to lose inches I used to always buy fajas which are very uncomfortable and takes alot of getting used to I wear them most of the day and throughout the night This one is more comfortable as something squeezing u can be and looks good under certain clothes I like that the inside is a rubbery material that helps u sweat It speeds up the weight loss process I plan to buy the next size down soon because my waist has already shrank I probably will buy the one with the straps next time because the strapless does kinda push ur back fat up and with certain clothes you can see it All in all its a great product and the most comfortable cincher Ive ever bought"
"1","Poor qualityI purchased this item to wear postpartum I love how it fits and how well it smooths things out post baby The major downside to this is the poor quality The eye portion of about five of the hookeye closures has come out entirely I know that this is not a sizing issue because I followed the sizing for the product and its only select ones that appear to not have been sewn as well as the rest Very disappointing for what would have otherwise been an awesome product that I could recommend to others to instead be a waste of my money"
"2","Squeem Perfect Waist Firm compressionIm a 100 satisfied with the Squeem Magical Lingerie Shapewear It delivers what it promises everything that describes the product its true It reduces about 2 inches instantly it hardly shows with thin clothes it doesnt let me eat a lot and I feel full the rest of the day It recommends to wear it about 8 hours but I can even sleep with it the only thing is that I get marks like when wearing thigh socks it gives me a smaller waist than what the picture shows and its the perfect length for my coreIm 53 I tried another brand before but it was too long for me I could feel the wires poking specially when bending down I recommend to measure yourself before ordering any brandOnce I get used to this one Im planning to order the Extra firm compression It gives more back support and it will reduce the waist even more"
"1","Not the best shaperThis would be great if it had boning in it I am not sure if this os because i have a very pronounced hour glass figure but when I put it on the fabric slides the the waist and it has the same effect as if I had a rubber band aroun my waist forming a bulge above and below my waist Too bad I had hoped this would work based on reviews"
"1","It works BUTMy size medium was true to size This made my waist smaller and while I had it on I didnt eat as much because of the pressure it makes me feel full however all of the cinchers do this as it is its purpose I did like the fact that its shorter from the lower back and a bit longer on the tummy BUTTT a HUGE BUT for me What I didnt like was that it made big bulges of fat on my upper back eewww and I dont even have back fat So to me this defeats the whole purpose All it did was cover my stomach fat but GAVE me back fat Also whats going on with the price increase I just bought this 3 weeks ago for 30 now its 45"
"2","squeemI like it because it came as I was expecting that and really helped to save money compare to other stores"
"1","Product defective after 1 day of useThe product overall was comfortable and did shape nicely The problem is that after only 1 day of wearing the product was bunched at the waist and the interior supports were bent without repair I contacted the company and they did say I had the correct size and to wear a tank under the Squeem to help with bunching This didnt help the bent supports and I returned the product"
"2","a great buyafter baby 2 I knew I wanted to try binding as a form of getting my tummy back as soon as possible I am so glad that I bought the squeem it really does cinch your waist giving you an unreal hourglass shape I began wearing mine 1 week postpartum and people just couldnt believe that I had just had a baby Now that I am 7 months postpartum I wear mine to the gym for extra back and abdominal support It has really helped give me my old shape back and even seems to have nipped in my waist more than it was before"
"1","NoNoNo This is not for meI own the vest squeem and I absolutely love it But this waist cincher is not for me Im not gonna say dont buy it because alot of women are shaped differentI just got it yesterday and Im sending it back It fit well until my back fat overlapsed over the top of the cincher and thats not attractive at all So if you know you have more than enough back fat this is not for you I tried to adjust it by pulling it up or down and that didnt even help I wear a size medium so its my correct size But it doesnt give me the full coverage support that the vest gives me The vest covers all the back fat and everything But I still give Squeem thumbs up though"
"2","Cant Go Wrong With This ItemI recently purchased the Power Cotton Rubber Waist Cincher and loved it so much I thought Id give this one a try as well As far as the smell its very faint Washing it prior to use and putting plenty of dryer sheets in should help the smell diminish pretty quickly The fit was nice comfortable But its not a solid black like youd assume Prepare for a charcoal blackgray color for the exterior The interior rubber WILL make you sweat ladies so get ready to have a sticky abdomen at the end of the day The same thing with the waist cincher the back begins to bunch up and make wrinkles after a few daysOverall great product"
"1","Would be great butThe package says it goes from lower belly to just under bust I am a short woman and it doesnt reach my ribs leaving me with two huge rolls of fat on the front and back It takes me in great love that about it but because it isnt long enough I cant wear it anywhere"
"1","works but uncomfortableHeld my tummy in when I tried it on but was way too stiffthe boning and the hooks showed through so could not even wear it inside a tshirt Was tough to wear and I was scared of pinching myself while wearing it"
"1","Major let downI bought this product based on the positive reviews I wish I hadnt bought this waist cincher The bottom of the cincher ends in a weird triangle which goes about 4 inches on my thigh the bottom wrinkles up and looks ugly it is extremely visible under a normal tshirt and it looks TERRIBLE if you sit down while wearing it This looks decent barely when youre standing up and you might as not wear it if you ever need to sit down The length is way off it goes 4 inches down to my thigh and up to an inch from my armpits Im 53 and weight 125 lbs This looks terrible and Im sending it back the same day it was delivered Save your money"
"2","AwsomeReally a life saver when it comes to go to a nice party and try to look spectacular especially for me that i give birth 7 months ago and im still try to work out the few pounds and belly i have left from that really i recomended Money well spend it"
"1","Wasnt worthI bought a pink rubber squeem which had a seperate cotton cloth That worked well but i wonder why i dint buy the same and ended up with this This product hurts me on my left hip and i got scars on my left hip"
"2","GREAT THERAPEUTICALLY AS WELL AS GREAT FOR FASHIONI had two reasons for the purchase of this product one was for my spine difficulties thanks to a severe injury many years ago the other was pure vanity But it has surpassed my expectations for both reasons It is ever so comfortable and makes me look great so I feel beautiful I just cannot express in words how great this product is"
"1","Not so muchProduct is as shown but they didnt have it in stock and it took them almost a month to ship And then instead of sending next day to compensate they sent it regular mail so it took another week to receive Not too happy with their customer service"
"1","Burn Rubber on MeI went by the Squeem chart and my waist measurements to find the correct size but to my suprise the waist cincher did not fit Warning you cannot return for a refund only merchandise creditexchange Also the cincher smelled like burnt rubber Very bulky and will be visible through clothing so you cannot wear with tight fitting clothing"
"1","Not worth the priceI bought this to slim down my tummy under a bridesmaid dress First it smelled horrific and still stunk like rubber after washing Second it did almost nothing to slim me down even though I bought the suggested size Third after about a half hour of wearing it it was absorbing sweat and making me feel clammy and uncomfortable It was extremely uncomfortable to sit down in and the boning showed through the relatively thick cotton of the dress I abandoned it completely and felt much better"
"1","TortureToo tightwanted to help me get back in shape after my baby couldnt even close the whole thingReturned it ASAP"
"1","SqueemThe product states that inches will be removed after 30 days of use and I have worn this item everyday for at least 12 hrs per day and I have not seen any kind of differenceFor the price of the item it is disappointing when it advertises and does not comply"
"2","Im very impressed so farSo I just got mine today and I put it on right out of the box Like some have said takes a few minutes to get used to it Ive been wearing it for 5 hours now and I just love it It covers everything that needs to be covered and I am longwaisted It stays put which I love Its comfortable It makes my waist look great and flattens my stomach pooch Its comfortable enough to sit in Best of all instant posture makeover and it is easing my lower back pain by providing support Im looking forward to wearing this for a long time and already foresee a black one in my future I wonder if I can wear it on my runs Hmmm Also I have a size 31 inch waist and the medium fits perfect on the first loops Just take your measurements before you order Hopefully as I lose weight from my runningtraining program I can cinch it to the tighter loops and get a little more use out of it Well then Ill just have to get a size small I love it"
"2","Not for everyoneI was really excited to try this however it is not for everyone I have a flat stomach just flabby and then I have love handles so I thought this would just hold everything in but thats not how it worked for me It feels great when I have it on but when I look in the mirror I have this pooch in the front that I didnt have before It takes the extra from the sides and puts it all in the front I think I would rather have the love handles I do like the way it feels and the back support is great so I only wear it with baggy shirts Not exactly why I bought it but o well I still gave it 4 stars because it is still working for me just not how I thought it would"
"2","Squeem A Combination of Scream and SqueezeI first ordered size XL but that was too big so I returned it and bought a L The first couple of wearings were difficult but then the product becomes slightly stretched and begins to conform slightly to your body I do wear a stretchy tube underneath it sort of like the top part of panty hose I try to wear it while I am standing or walking around It is not comfortable to wear while sitting For me I think it would be more comfortable if it were about one inch shorter as I think my torso is shorter than most I do think it is helping but I need to wear it for more hours I am thinking of wearing it while I sleep rather than in the daytime but I have not tried that yet The product is well made"
"2","excelent productThis product does what is said in the description my waist got smaller and I can stand for hours withoutfeeling any pain on my back My work requires a lot of lifting this product help protect my back I love it Is my second buy The price is also good the first one I got cost me 55 this time I paid 36 for it"
"1","Hard to put onThe shape wear is difficult to put on and you can see the seams through your clothes It is hard to bend over especially as a school teacher I would definitely like to try Brooke Burkes Belly Taut instead of this old school shapewear"
"1","Why does everybody rave whenThis product sucksIt doesnt completely suck the 2 days I was able to wear it before the boning snapped in half it did compress pretty tight As many people have noted it is HELL to get into this the first timeI liked that this wasnt a body suit and the rubber on the outside would keep my shirt from sliding upBUTThis garment1 Rides up if you move a lot it will eventually slide up your waist2 Leaves a huge crease on the skin above your waist and it hurts3 Makes you look like a sausage when you sit down visually divides your belly in half when you sitAs I said I only wore this twice first time I wore it for about half hour and the second time I had worn it for several hours when the boning snapped in half and was poking into my side ouch RETURNING THIS"
"1","UncomfortableIt was really easy to put the Squeem on but once it was on I couldnt wait to get it off It wasnt too tight or anything The problem was that once I stood up straight it bunched up in the hipmid back area and pinched my skin It was so painful No matter how I positioned it it would bunch up Really disappointed since it was a waste of 50"
"1","Great idea poor designThis shapewear is the best Ive had until now regarding easiness to wear and puton It does a great job at keeping the postpregnancy flabby belly under control However after about 2 months of daily use the metal that gives the support is coming out from the fabric It seems that the metal is rubbing out the fabric and thins it enough to come out I wish there was a better designed support for this binder Otherwise it is awesome good looking for such lingerie So if you buy it expect 2 months of wearing it without problems"
"2","best shapewearit the best shapewear says what it does everyone ask how you look so small bought 3 for friends loveit"
"1","Waste of time for meI really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to love it It didnt hold anything in on me and it gave me back boobs Waste of money for me"
"1","Not OKWhen I ordered this I thought it would allow me to wear some clothes that I havent been able to do in a while because of my weight gainI am a woman who has size 40D in breasts so I wear a large in tops and I wear a size 8 in pants and weight 140lbs It is suppose to clinch your waist and give you a nice looking figure Well it did hug my waist but it also gave my a muffin top Not a shape a woman wants to have I looked better without wearing it It folds into your folds creating a bigger fold at the top of your body I would say this item is more for the extremely skinny female who has small breasts no hips or ass Not for a woman who has large breast hips and ass Not for women who are going through postpregnancy either For a product thats is suppose to make you feel good about yourself it failed"
"1","Not worth the pain it causesSqueem Shapewear definitely does the job of sucking you in However I found that the rods painfully poked me on the side and ultimately resulted in a wound Not worth the pain"
"2","I love Itit does what it is supposed to do making you look slimmer in the waist area my grandmother even notice it and she didnt even know i bought it It really makes you look smaller in that area of your body I would most likely buy another one but next time in a small not medium"
"1","disappointedI think this is a case of my expectations being too high I was so encouraged by the great reviews of this product I really was expecting a miracle After only wearing this twice it is stretched out At first I thought perhaps it would regain its shape after a few hours but nope Its no better than a cheap fashion corset It will smooth things out so theres less bulging under the clothes but I was looking for a real waist trainer something that would go on tight and STAY tight Considering I found this product when I searched specifically for waist trainer I would say the claims of this product are misleading It is shapewear it is NOT a cincher or a trainer"
"1","itchyI washed it before used it for the first time The next day I wore it I found my skin were itchy all over place on my stomach And I feel that the heat on my body trapped on that"
"2","i love iti realy love my shape wear i got one for myself and one for my daughter and shes notice a big difference"
"2","Wow Ow and Whats that smellI have been using this for 3 weeks now and while I have seen no difference in my measurements my posture is definitely improved I have also lost about 6 pounds which is likely due to my combination of diet and exercise but I have also been wearing the corset at least 4 days a week for up to 9 hours at a timeI am 59 150 pounds and I bought a size Small and it fits how it should super tight I look forward to eventually going in to the second hooksMy only complaint is the SMELL It smells like rubber and while I hope no one around me really notices I notice I wear a wrap around my midsection underneath it but after all day the smell still gets on and stays on my skinOtherwise the construction is super sturdy and I anticipate only needed one for a long time Hopefully the smell will fade with more hand washes"
"2","squeem is pretty goodi have a 2829 inch waist normally shouldve started with a size Small the XS seemed a bit smaller than described definitely gets the job done in cinching the waist"
"2","Snug FitGreat product for giving you that snug fitit does become very uncomfortable around the waist line if worn to long I really do like this item the only BIG issue I have is the fact that you can see the snaps through your clothingso I suggest not wearing this with a tight fitting dress or shirt because everyone will know your secret"
"1","Poor quality and lousy customer serviceThe Squeem is a great idea but their quality is second rate and their customer service is worse than useless Id owned mine for about 4 weeks and worn it only a few hours a day when I noticed that a seam was coming unstitched The threads arent frayed theyre unstitching from the seamContacting customer service has been an exercise in futility Theyve asked for pictures of the damage and then failed to respond to the pictures or any further attempts to contact themFor what this costs it needs to last longer than 4 weeks"
"1","IN THE TRASH IT GOESHello I am a woman nearing my 60s and my waist certainly isnt getting any smaller I purchased this product in the hopes that it would shrink my evergrowing belly To accommodate for my girth I bought the Squeem Magical Lingerie Shapewear in XXXXXLarge the largest size available WELL heres a bit of magic for ya sisters The second I snapped the first two hooks together the tightness was unbearable It felt like it was squeezing my waist fat straight down to my giant ass Fortunately the discomfort didnt last long since the hooks flew off and therefore ruined the Squeem altogether These things need to come in larger sizes Not even worthy of 1 star More worthy of steaming diarrhea"
"2","Very sturdyThis item is very sturdy and holds in the belly area better than another softer belt I have The measurements seem true to size and there are two rows of hooks so you can adjust if you lose some weightThe only negative points are that the item smells badly of rubber when new It must be washed before wearing The other is that all that rubber can make you sweat But those are minor complaints if you want to look good for an evening The belt also helps me sit straight so I think its good for the back as well as the front"
"1","Worked for 5 days then brokeI liked how it pulled everything in I felt fantastic for about 2 hours it really flattens the tummy area which is all I really want but you can see the hooks threw clothes I felt like that ruined it for me also I had to keep pulling it up It bunches in the back and really smells like rubber After about 5 or 6 days one of the bones on the inside broke and was stabbing me in the side it really hurt I would not recommend this product"
"2","does its jobrecommend itit really slim out my waist line clearly cleanlyhope i could buy it in beige color could be little cheaper"
"2","SqueemLove this product I wear it when I am doing my cardio to help with weight loss It is true to size"
"2","So Far So GoodIve only worn this for a day so far but I love it I still have a little bit of a tummy from the birth of my son 8 months ago This really holds you in its comfortable and I dont think it shows through your clothes I highly recommend"
"2","Makes me look like a i have a perfect hourglass figureI love how this product makes me look in my clothes its shapes me into a perfect hourglass i dont know if the claim that it permanantley reduces your waist after 30 days is true because i havent had it that long my only complaints are that it is a little too short so i still have a small bulge over the top in vthe back and i think it may be stretching out as i wear it as oppossed to it shrinking me but overall it is the best shapewear i have ever purchased i love it and would recommend it to anyone"
"2","simple quick fixI bought this product to slim my waist and I really didnt have big expectations for it at all I figured Id wear it under my clothes for a more defined shape Ive been wearing it for a month already and Ive seen my waist go down 2 inches I wear it all day at work from 700 till about 300 It fit snug in the beginning but after one week I had to go to the tighter hooks and even that is too big now and I may need to buy a small I actually like wearing it but I recommend wearing a tank top under it because it will start to press into your skin and kind of make you sore hence the 4 star rating Im very happy with this product for the price It works better than Spanx"
"2","A must haveThis is a must have if you desire a smooth look in shirts and dresses It also offers great support for your back It is perfect for everyday wear"
"2","The squeem waist cincherThe squeem waist cincher was GREAT for about three weeks it does exsactly what it says until the wire that supports the squeem started to come out and the other wire broke on the other side and the squeem started To crease in the waist and stretch out turning it into the scream i would say if you get this product its best to buy two of them so you could switch off and it wouldnt damage as fast but for the three weeks that I had it I was very happy I am going to buy it again but this time Ill get two of them"
"1","Wasnt that impressedIt didnt do much to slim the midsection and all it does is pretty much push everything up to the top making your breasts and back look MUCH wider If I do continue to wear it it will be around the house or under loose clothesjackets"
"2","Squeeeeeze into your clothesI really liked the Squeem Im a petite person but have some love handles that I need to hide when Im wearing tight clothes The only problem is that it has boning which you feel in your ribs when its tight"
"2","Love itThis works really well I used it to help get my abdominal wall back together at 9 months postpartum Its still a bit separated but this definitely helped I wish I knew about it sooner It also helps support the back when picking up my child over and over and over again and a good reminder to keep my weak abs pulled in when doing it Great to wear during exercise again as a reminder to keep the abs in and strengthen them correctly inward Also it looks hot And sometimes I wear it out I wear it with a tank top underneath as suggested in other reviews all the time Suggest getting seamless tanktops otherwise irritation may occur 27 waist before pregnancy 30 waist when I bought a size medium 28 now and could probably get the next size down if I really wanted"
"2","Good productI read the reviews for this product and purchased I am an Ardyss wearer and after that brand this one is a piece of cake I purchased a small but need an extra small because I can wear it all day comfortably For me if I dont feel a slight discomfort in the beginning I dont feel its working The thing I like the most about it is thats its strapless and can be worn with almost any type of top Body hugging tops excluded of course I recommend it if you want to go extra sexy for a night on the town"
"1","Waste of moneyThe product worked fine on the first day and now it doesnt work as described on the advert Ive never been so sore both side in my entire life I cannot wear it for more than 2h Other then the product itself the delivery system was also misleading I choose a 58 days delivery when i placed the order but the product was delivered a month later What made me even more annoyed was the fact that I had to pay for the post charges because apparently the sender didnt use correct stamp or pay the full charge"
"1","I got burned after few hours wearing itthe first day 8 hours wearing it it hurt me so bad my skin was torned itched swell deep red I tried to wear other side after few hours I got deep burned both on the right and left belly the skin was torned swell bleeding lot of cross cut on the skin itched for a week until now It looked like I was beaten up or have skin diseaseI am scared to dead when I look at it now I dont know why I got it I used something like this before but I didnt get any bad thing or the rubber hurt me"
"1","does not fit meSo according to the size chart on the box size small is for waistline 2831my waist is 28 so i got the smallit does not even come close to being able to close and claspmaybe its just me but i am terribly disappointed"
"1","Bulky feels gross not worth orderingI read up on bellywrapping after my csection and bought a couple compression tanktops from WalMart which worked nicely I wanted something without straps and something with more compression and purchased the Squeem Perfect Waist on Amazon after reading rave reviews When I received it and tried it on it felt disgusting on my skin It was uncomfortable and totally noticeable even without a supertight or thin shirt on especially when I sat down The seams and the boning are all very noticeable and the rubber makes clothes catch and stick in a really weird way like something would stick to you if you were really sweaty I have wore corsets for years and this is by far the grossest feeling and least comfortable thing I have ever put on my body I returned it immediately"
"1","Caused damage to my stomach musclesFelt great until it dug into my waist while sitting causing damage to my surgical site Now Im in pain with and without it on"
"2","Great productJust what I needed to get me headed back toward my prepregnancy waist Bought an XL and probably could have fit into the large Looking to down size soon"
"2","Great productGreat fit Does exactly what it is suppose to Plan to buy more in different colors Sent in good order"
"2","Love itIt was everything it was advertised to be Im going to get another one Got so many compliments at the party that I wore it to Made my outfit look really great"
"2","very goodthis product is awesome it hide all your secrets I would recommend this product to all women and men I will buy product again"
"2","It worked for meThought this was not going to fit because I am a 44 currently and I only ordered XL Like it very much"
"1","Not what I expectedThis product was not what I expected so I returned it Too tight sizing was misleading Ill stick with my Spanx"
"1","Too smallUsually a size XS to S but this girdles small did not fit true to size Had to return back to Amazon"
"2","perfectGot this so I could start performing againdrag queenand have put on a few pounds around the mid area I didnt want to lose the eaight because i would lose my rear but all I want to do was lose the tummy Had to have a friend help me put it on at first but wore it all day then half way through the day we went to the second latch and gave me the form I needed to fit back into my outfits Works great and like they say pain is beauty and this is so worth it"
"2","AMAZINGI waited a while before I reviewed so that I could give a GOOD review and this works amazing trust me you need to get used to it but you WILL and please buy according to size chart it does stretch after sometime but you need to SUCK IT IN when you first put it in my lower belly pudge is almost gone"
"2","Its amazingIt really works I am in love I was trying to get my prepregnancy 21 in waist back for 10 months now I got to 23in and kind of got stuck there With Squeem I went from 23 in waist to 21in in just 2 minutes Start hooking it from the top much easier Buy it You wont regret"
"1","AwesomeIts pretty awesome for such a price It definitely gives you great posture I was sitting up straight like no other although i wish they could improve on the rubber smell otherwise its wonderful was my review when i had it for 1520 days now after ordering it on Jan 21 2012 its SO useless Ive washed it with care it smells like rubber and its pretty nasty Id rather pay and buy something that works the way it should"
"1","Fall apartI dont understand why these inserts are made up from 2 pieces It should just be one piece The 2 pieces are held together with a small piece of double sided tape and COMPLETELY fall apart after 1 day of walking No problem with seller this is just a HORRIBLY made product"

"1","Dont order them in white or any light colorWe have owed these plates in white for quite some years maybe six or more I just replaced all of them with a set from Crate and Barrell They are heavy and seemingly well made but they have been faulty in a a number of ways First my biggest complaint is on the white plates everytime you happen to scrape them with silverware it leaves a permanent mark Never wash anything stainless near them in the diawasher since it will mark it up there as well if it rubs up against them After years of use they looked horrible with marks all over them They also seemed to chip very easily So between the chips and marks all over them I couldnt take looking at them anymore They also are not good in the microwave They get very hot and the food not so much I would not recommend for everyday use Maybe the dark colors would show less marks but if they chip it will be very noticable My advice is to purchase bone china or porcelain I will never buy these again"

"2","Legend of Dragoon SoundtrackThis soundtrack is amazing It has all the songs you want to hear most though it doesnt have all the songs Ive played the Legend of Dragoon for a very long time Its a great game and you really notice the music once you hear it on the soundtrack Amazing game and musicI highly recommend itLogan"

"1","HorribleThis movie was horrible It did not play right when I was watching it online I liked how it went by old vampire styles Such as crosses worked and you had to invite them in and such But the ending was really bad Do not waste your money on this one Also the storyline did not really make much sense"

"2","Religion and profitsAn excellent scholarly book Great detail and very in depth analysis Inevitable conclusion is the impossibility of molding an economic system out of a moral philosophy not just Islam That is where the problem with traditional Islamic thought arises for most of its adherents Islam is not just a set of moral principles but a way of life dictating every aspect of it Unavoidably there was much effort by Islamists to set up a distinct system of banking and economy based on pure Islamic traditions Prof Kuran delves into the history of these movements but he does more than that he puts all this in cultural and political context At the end he bravely expands more on the general failure of Islamic culture and tradition to bring wealth and prosperity to the masses that follow it Writing is very formal not the easiest read and surley apporpriate only for the truly intersted in the general topic but it was well worth it for this reader"

"2","Finally on CDI have this still on vinyl its great to see it out there on CD even if its an import Super Strut and Rhapsody in Blue alone are worth it One of the must haves for a collection of 70s jazz Caan we get the rest of the CTI Catalog back out therePlease"
"1","WARNING This is the worst book ever writtenAs most people readers know Jack Higgins has written many fine actionpacked books However this book reads like a twelveyearold wrote it The characters are so transparent they could be ghostsThe author and his publishing house must really need the money to rip of the public in this manner This is the last book I read by this author One can only rest on his laurels for so long Im glad this book was handed down to me or I would have written a really nasty review"
"1","Edge of DangerSomebody from higher places should have stopped Mr Higgins and the publisher from putting this book on the marketIts quite disturbing to see the absence of integrity and sense of responsibility in providing a joy of reading to the publicAll along I had fight off the growing urge of disposing this disastrous novel only because the shipping charge cost more than the book itselfYet once I overcame my frustration and finished the book I regretted not heeding to my sensesIts obvious that Mr Higgins had no heart in writing this book and he made no effort in showing creativity with wordsI was about to scream my head off when he kept rehashing the same phrases eg browning with carswell silencer over and over again in every single chapterThis book made me a true antiHiggins"
"1","Edge of Danger1 star only because thats the minimumThis book proves the famous can publish anything"
"1","Actually this book is not worth one starThis is my very first book review Because this book is so fundamentally wrong I need to speak up The main character Sean Dillion formal IRA has a license to kill and make the killing like a game rather than justice He does whatever he wants to do without follow orders nor has any boundary He pickup a couple of his terrorismcriminal partners making killing like a habits terrorism competition fun game and egoism fulfillment It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity The killings like a joke to him and have absolutely no legal consequence This book has promote violence behavior has no artist nor entertainment value I lost my interest in Jack Higgins Sean Dillions serial after finishing this ridicules book"
"1","Not Worth The Readers TimeIts a hard slog to read a book written by someone just going through the motionsJack Higgins drags out his stock company of characters Sean Dillon and his 22 in an ankle holster and glasses of Bushmills and cardboard villians and its just a boreThe action isnt believable The plot is silly The dialogue is written to tell the reader whats going on and every character speaks with the same voice this isnt how real people speak Then the characters overexplain because apparently the author wasnt paying attention when he gave you the same information a dozen or so pages agoFrankly Ive read enough about the IRA and Prods and One Para and County Down to last me the rest of my born days It just isnt worth it anymore Jack Too much work reading for too little reward"
"1","Disappointing and too simplisticThis minimalism style of writing exposes too much reliance on characters and events from previous books with little descriptive detail of some promising locations The action is thin as well characters die frequently and quickly with little build up or detail Character motivation is weak at times and contributes to an arid experience with a predictable climax"
"1","Worst Book Ive Ever ReadThis is simply the worst book I remember reading I enjoyed a couple other Jack Higgins novels so I happily picked this up Im sorry I did It is nothing but action which might be OK for a fun read on the beach but even the action is so poorly written it is ridiculous Massive action scenes such as large battles take place in only 1 or 2 pages Theres no character development poor dialogue no setting descriptions no drama or suspense nothing but a poorlydescribed series of events Enough said"
"1","Formula WritingI have been a Higgins fan for many years and have read and collected almost all of the books he has written Some were great and full of suspense But the last three he has written including this one Edge of Danger are very disappointing He has resorted to producing 2 books a year based on the formula of a superficial story line with no depth predictable characters and it seems that he now writes just to capitalize on his prior reputation as a good suspense writerCount the number of Marlboros smoked the amount of Bushmills and champagne drank and in the midst he changes his champagne brand which makes one wonder whether he has received a better commission from one favorite to another and you find a shallow book I would save my money on this one and buy it only if you collect Higgins First Editions hoping to capitalize someday on the commercial side of selling all Higgins books to a collector"
"1","Edge of Danger by Jack HigginsI was a big fan of Jack Higgins adventures until this book I think this book reads like a poorly written condensed version of a good story or like the outline of a book It jumped around too abruptly with poorly written dialogue no conversation was stretched into a normal length of exchange between people It was difficult to keep track of all the minor characters in the book because none of them were well developed I will proabably never read another Jack Higgins book I am very disappointed just like I got with Robert Ludlum in one of his later novels I have never read another book of his either"
"1","Worst of theYearor maybe the decadeWhere did the real Jack Higgins go This is not only Higgins worst effort to date it is probably the worst book Ive read in the past 5 years Can you say lazy JackI cant believe I actually finished it and one star is a generous rating Unbelievable chapter after unbelievable chapter no character or plot development written like a 5th graderThe end of the book foretells a sequela book that I will immediately pass on Probably my last Higgins book without reading the reviews firstDont buy it dont borrow it dont read it"
"1","Writing on autopilotAfter reading this book I felt guilty for having purchased it because that contributed to its bestseller status Oops maybe not the way it works now it was a bestseller the day it hit ths stores But it is sad to think of all the aspiring writers who struggle to get a publishers attention for their worthy efforts while this strangely hollow piece waltzed its way to bestseller status Some editor should have thrown cold water on this potboiler"
"1","Sophomoric at BestHaving read only one other Higgins book before Cold Harbor I hesitate somewhat to comment on the authors general talent However this book has to be one of the worst Ive read in some time I think the thing that got me the most was the dialog unbelievably simplistic and totally formulaic Damn he said to Kate Its the Hazar Scouts Puhleeze Not even an exclamation mark Many other examples could be given Now assuming for the moment that the dialog was say written at greater than a 7th grade level the plot is almost as bad The protagonists reactions to their fellows getting knocked off onebyone is almost comic Theres no depth here just one simple vignette after another I wouldnt even want to compare this to Ludlum or Clancy although Clancys gotten a bit rough of lateA terrific waste of a good"
"1","A Waste of TimeThis book is not well written and leaves nothing to the imagination If I hadnt bought it in hard cover and spent the money I would not even have finished reading it"
"2","Plenty of actionThis is my second Higgins novel and I am reall getting into this world that has been created by the author I have learned a lot of the IRA in ways that I find pretty entertaining if at times a little fantasticThe story once again centers around Dillon the bad boy of the IRA that is now working for the British His mission is to stop this family of half British and half Arab bilionairesThe action is nonstop and pretty interestng Its a quick read sometime that is to the point and nothing really deepThe only compaint that I have is that I want to know more of Dillon but little by little we are seeing more of the character and some character growth"
"1","Good story Poor writingVery simplistic writing style he said she said then he said then she said This reads like a first attempt not like a book written by a seasoned author of over 30 books"
"1","Do I have to give it 1starIve never written a review but my curiosity about what others thought of this book was a thousand times more compelling than the Edge of Danger Ive enjoyed Mr Higgins books in the past but cant for the life of me understand a why he wrote this book or b why it was published There is no plot no character development predictable action no tension Its like reading an Executive Summary of a book Are you sure they didnt publish the outline by mistake"
"1","Disappointment on every pageIm so glad that this was not my first Jack Higgins novel If it were it would also be my lastNormally I can forgive Higgins his cliches and his obsessive attention to his characters drinking habits because his characters are fun and interesting He puts them in great plots and pulls the reader happily through them and you cant wait to find the next book especially if its got Sean DillonBut not this one All the characters are wooden The action is colorless and completely unbelievable A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone elseThere is no sense of timing or place only the thinnest of motivations for most characters and no justification for many of the decisions made by charactersThis book is amateur hour Dont bother Read some of Higginss earlier works instead"
"1","I would rather watch paint dryBoy this was a disappointing read The characters were not well developed hence challenging to keep track of the plot was implausible yet predictable and half way through I had to wrestle with whether or not to even finish the book I did although it was unrewarding to do soId rate this lower if I couldFYI if youre looking for an alternate selection in the same genre I highly recommend Silent Joe by T Jefferson Parker"
"1","Tired formulaJack Higgins may not be running out of his fascination with modern weapons fine dining glamorous women or the IRA but he appears to be slipping on plot and character development Sean Dillon makes Doc Savage and Dirk Pitt look like pikers And this curious extension of gentlemanly methods for attempting to kill one another sending a crazed assassin and then both sides meeting later at the Savoy to exchange notes strains credulityHiggins has done some firstrate work Had this been published twentyfive years ago this might have made a difference It wasnt and it doesnt"
"1","This is not the Jack Higgins I knowThis is by far his worst effort that Ive read Hes not my favorite spy authoranyway This book feels like it had been written to fulfill a publishers contract or obligation that Mr Higgins had assumed and needed to finish in a hurry The characters are not at all fleshed out and the story line is too contrived I would advise not wasting time by reading this book"
"1","Completely predictableUp to now I have enjoyed almost all of the Higgins books although they have tended to become more samey I was particularly disappointed by Edge Of Danger The tired old characters of Dillon Ferguson etc are dragged out again for this entirely predictable highly contrived and unbelievable yarn The plots have all been used before and if youve read any two other Dillon books youll be able to guess the next line throughout I bought it to read on the plane was bored by check in and had finished it long before boarding Give this one a miss"
"1","EXTREMELY SHALLOWThis book has no plot and is so absolutely predictable that I had to put it away without finishing Sean Dillons character is getting so tired and his invincibility is sickening A very poorly written book The only good thing about this book is that I got it from the local libary and did not spend any money on it Mr Higgins its time to retire Sean Dillon and maybe spend more than 2 weeks on writing a book"
"1","Cartoon ArabScottish VillainI had the rare experience of giving up on a novel after only a couple of chapters when trying to read Edge of Danger recently but Higgins managed to pen a book so lame that I refused to go any further His bad guy is supposedly a ScottishArabian aristocrat but comes off as just another cartoon Arab terrorist with an implausible pointless heritage But what do you expect from a middleaged author who poses in bomber jacket and aviator glasses on the dust jacket depth"
"1","Cant believe I read the whole thingGiven the lack of character development or rather simplistic and at times contradictory character development the lack of any plot whatsoever and poor visualizations I cant believe I read the whole book I guess I kept waiting for the action to start It never did"
"1","Id rate it 0 stars if I could haveVery few books contain their own review This one doesStone said It really is like a bad movie HarryYou can bleeding well say that again This book reads like a 7th grade readinglevel condensation of an outline of a screenplay The paragraphs are no more than a few lines long very few words greater than two syllables are used No complex thoughts no character development no suspense and little description Pure formulaic twaddle"
"1","A bad book poorly writtenThe plot is not believable there is not a shred of character development and there isnt even any descriptive atmosphere It shocks me that Jack Higgins and the publishers actually make money off of this puerile drivel I shall not buy any more of his efforts"
"1","higgins disappointsThis is without a doubt Higgins least inspired work in years The plot is predictable and over worn and the books is very uninspired A real disappointment"
"1","Poorly WrittenThe style of writing leads me to believe that Higgins was under pressure to churn out a book to meet some editors deadline There was no character development Critical turns in the plot and action were blown through without the slightest bit of suspense Ive never read Higgins before and likely will never read him again"
"1","A DisappointmentIt is hard to believe that the same author wrote The Eagle Has Landed and Edge of Danger The writing is just plain shallow the plot predictable Save your money for something better"
"1","HorribleThis is my first Jack Higgins book and it will certainly be my last Especially if as the reviews state it is the best Higgins book in a long timeThe characters are never developed The way the book begins you think that the Rashids are the good guys and Dillin is the bad guy Then all the sudden without developing the characters the roles are switched You end up not caring who dies and 6 billion people die in this booka little overkill and who livesThe adventures are similar to Dora the Explorer in how boring they are They are very predictable and of course Dillin is killing 50 people and no one can kill him Just ridiculous scenesDont get this book despite the reliablity of the author"
"1","Not worth the effortEdge of Danger is yet another installment of the ongoing saga of Dillon Ferguson and Bernstein If you truly enjoyed the preceding efforts by Higgins then you might like Edge of Danger because it is more of the same However if you have been growing disenchanted by Higgins efforts then you probably want to take a pass on this and for me at least future efforts as well Higgins books are more and more like screen plays and less and less like novels Dialog between the characters which often is terse choppy and unimaginative makes up virtually all of the text Higgins almost completely avoids the opportunity add any depth and breadth to the story through the use of descriptive text As with the last few books from Higgins Edge of Danger is clearly a disappointment"
"1","Cant believe the publisher had nerve to issue this bookA terrible childishly written book with absolutely NO redeeming value as literature Higgins loves to speak Irish but even that gambit fails in this trite poorly plotted worthless endeavour by a writer who should remain retired if he cant do any better than such trashy writing"
"1","Disappointing and thinI purchased this book expecting very good things I found the plot very thin and predictable There was very little suspense It almost seemed like an abridged version of a book where all the detail leading up was left out Also there didnt seem to be any character building or background to explain why these individuals would have such singleminded and on the surface stupid behaviour"
"1","Two HacksI dont know who is worse Higgins or Macnee The plot is so tranparent you can guess what is coming next Completely implausible Macnees narration is so overdone it is laughable Most of the time the characters do little more than quaff enormous amounts of Bushmills Irish Whisky A real stinker Wayne Schwartz Los Angeles CA"
"1","Just skip itWhen you read a book you know that what are you reading is not 100 true but when you start to read things that are completely wrong is another thing For an example I have these questionsQ How many times could a man pay another man to kill somebody the killer fails and the boss gives him another chanceA I dont know if the mob knows it but at least four timesQ Why the target man who knows who is trying to kill him and he saw him in a restaurant after he was in danger and just say hello to himA Because the target man likes to be in dangerQ When the target man has the opportunity to kill the one whom wanted to kill him why doesnt heA Because something in his head didnt let him even if he had killed many men beforeAnd as the energizer rabbit I can keep going and going and going my advise is to skip this book"
"1","Worst Live recording Ive ever boughtI bought this CD for one song only Steal Away I knew it was going to be live but this isnt even close to the radio version Try more like a muzik lounge sound It was recorded in a ballroom Then the only other song I recognized was Hot Rod Hearts again done the Vegas lounge style I wish I could get my back Why didnt he just put out the CD using the regular recordings He was never a big star to begin with I wrote this review just to warn people that it isnt like most live recordings I was very dissapointed and I still dont have a decent recording of Steal Away"
"2","A Different Collection of Early StuffThis is among the first Ellington CDs I owned and remains among my favorites It presents a nice survey of earlier material with many of his greatest hits as well as some less familiar tunes ie ones you dont find on every collection of early Duke Ivie Andersons vocals really shine especially on It Dont Mean a Thing If It Aint Got That Swing Not every song was destined for greatness but the lyrics to Love is Like a Cigarette are a hoot The sound is decent considering the age of the recordings"
"2","Great referenceThe book was good Kept my interest In no way am I finished reading it It isnt a book to read from front to back The information on each herb is detailed Great reference material It was a good addition"
"2","Excellent Resource BookI picked up this version of the herbal Magick books because I wanted to see what mr Beyerl had t offer to this vast and sometimes conflicting magickal practiceAfter reading through the book and using the index to find what I am nedding I must say where is The Master Book Of Herbalism I want itMr Beyerl has done tons and tons of research on this material check out the Bibliography and it shows His entries are precise with magical associations common names and other names It also includes suggestions for useNot only that but it takes the time to explaint he various ways to use herbsThis is a wonderfull addition to any occult library"
"1","Has NO valueIf your studying herbs or medicinal plants this book should NOT be on your list of books to own IT IS WORTHLESS It is a Pagan Religion Book Plain and simple In my opinion it is for the study of WITCHCRAFT and the like"
"2","Really great baby book for your 4legged childrenThis is a wonderful book for anyone who loves their dogs as children I bought one for our 3 year old adopted beagle and am getting one for our daugherinlaws birthday for their rottie You can personalize it as you wish and I have included comic clippings Marmaduke Mutts etc that are appropriate along with the photos and have created the beginning of a great book for my best friend that I will keep forever"
"1","needs upgradeOnly has limited access to OBDII data stream unless you pay more money to upgrade the software"
"1","Only Windows XP and earlier SupportThis scanner works great but if you want to update the unit or use their printing software you can only run their drivers on a Windows XP machine or earlier Windows XP is over 10 years old You cant load the data from the scanner into your computer if you have Vista Windows 7 or Windows 8 They seem to have no plan to update their system for this scanner or any of the EZ Scan lineKeep in mind Microsoft is dropping support for Windows XP in spring of 2014 a little more than a year away Why dont they have something that works with more current computers especially when you can only buy one with Windows 7 or mostly now with Windows 8In addition for most of their models the firmware is 407 and I believe the 07 stands for 2007 as thats as current as the unit shows for cars If you have a car 2008 and later it doesnt show Have to ask why they dont want to update the software for their products and still expect people to buy them"
"1","not very well writtenThis book was well reviewed and I was very disappointed Even if its written for poor readers does it have to read like Dick and Jane Children are young not simpleminded Give kids real literature or they wont keep reading theyll plug in to the media"
"2","HypatiaA classic story based on history One of Hypatias crimes appears to have been ready to provide a hypothesis of a heliocentric universe long before Copernicus and with a much worse response from the Christian community"
"1","Scarlett LetterVery disappointed The book was missing several chapters Because it was needed for school we were forced to purchase another copy"
"1","BoringRidiculously long chaptersThe book I downloaded on my Nook and Kindle doesnt seem like the same one I read in school This version Bored me to tears"
"1","scarlet lettervery hard to read doesnt seem to go anywhere I am struggling to finish it and may just give up"
"1","The Scarlett LetterWritten in old English It was very hard to read as I had to think through most sentences to figure out what was being said"
"1","A thorn in the side of literatureHawthornes use of symbolism throughout the book is undeniable yet his obvious alcoholism takes over as the underlying factor present at all points He relies on ambiguity far too often without the build up to a climax The climaxes happened before the book started and only happened to a select few who read this book Read Atlas Shrugged Anthem or virtually anything by Aldous Huxley if you want some entertainment"
"2","A Moral Novel with a MysteryI read this book during a high school vacation Although the long words and unconventional characters did not catch my fancy the mystery involved in the story captivated me As the story developed I realized the profound intricacy of the plot The conclusion of the story was not happy nor did it even seem fair As one who knows Hawthornes puritan morality standards however I say that he communicated his message extremely well"
"2","Excellent BookI read this book for my 11th grade Lit class and I must admit the book was quite a shock Many of the books I have read have been nothing more than an attempt at delving into the inner parts of the human soul This book does much more than that It depicts the struggle of a man with himself and an outside enemy He commits one of the most unspeakable acts of the time and punishes himself constantly He lacks the courage to confess his crime and goes through a period of mental and physical torture He also faces the wrath a cruel and vicious enemy who lives for nothing more than to torture his victim All in all I believe it was an excellent book and I would reccomend it to anyone"
"1","technical problems with cassettesThis product requires a stereo player in which the balance is turned totally to the left Most auto systems have that capability However if you have Dolby or SurroundSound it can be difficult and maybe impossible to play the cassette without hearing two recordings at the same time Unfortunately neither the packaging nor the website will warn you of the problem You therefore should think before buying Once you have opened the packaging you may be unable to return the product"
"1","Mundane Tedious Just Plain BoringWith so many allusions in literature and culture to the infamous A worn by Hester Prynne I was very excited about reading Hawthornes masterpiece Needless to say I was extremely disappointed I did find the symbolism that dealt with Pearls fascination with her mothers A interesting but the rest of the book I did not Other than to be more literaraly savvy I would not recomend the book"
"1","Oh god kill me now this book is BADThis is my moms account I had the pleasure of reading this book in English this year I can honestly say it is the single most boring book Ive EVER read You will NEVER find someone my age that enjoys this story It has no action No suspense It isnt deep Things dont symbolize anything If they do then youre thinking too hard This book is not a classic It is the worst Id recommend copying a dictionary before Id ask you to read this pile DO NOT EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS"
"1","Absolute Waste of TimeMy 11th grade English teacher tortured me with this morbid book and I cant say if Ill ever forgive her Not only was this this book boring but Hawthorne unnecesary uses all sorts of complex language to convey one simple thought The only reason that I didnt give this book 1 star was because there was some art in the book and symbolism WAY OVERRATED"
"1","A Tedious ReadI hate Hawthornes style of writing Its overbloated and selfindulgent I wish hed just get to the point and stop blabbering on and on The plot of the book seems like a modern melodramatic soap opera All of the characters are onedimensional Im not going to say the book is poorly written but its written in a style that makes the book kind of boring and tedious to read Overall a disappointment"
"1","Classic ReallyI will never understand how Classics become Classics So far for school i Have had to read far to many Classics Dickens should be glad he is dead and does not have to read his books because they would probably kill him out of sheer boredomHawthorne creates an ok tale but really It gets dragged out and is suppose to be realistic Then he throws Pearl in there she is like some superhuman and belongs in fantasy I never really did believe in the whole they completely ostracized her but let her stitch everything That is just a bit hypocritical either she was excepted as prat of the society which she was not or she wasnt which she almost was See that just doesnt make any sense The story is suppose to show how unforgiving the society was but it doesnt It is better than Dickens but then again everything is"
"1","This book was OKThe Scarlet Letter for me was just a little boring Sometimes the description was just too long and I just started to lose interest in it Also sometimes it got confusing as to what the relationships the characters had to each other I would only reccomend this book to other people who liked reading lots of description a little dialouge and a repetitive storyline"
"1","Ive read betterIm a 13 year old kid and I just finished reading this book for an English class I am taking Although it was a very interesting and provkitive novel I did not like it very much I think it maybe that Im still too young to throughly understand this piece of literature"
"2","AwakeningThis book is a masterpiece of not only American literature but of world literature Reading this book was the experience that showed me what good literature is This is easily in my top three along with Fahrenheit 451 and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"
"1","The Scarlett LetterOverall ok Not much going on here A lot of internal dialogue nothing like the movie I prefer the movie to the book"
"2","Great Condition Almost Exactly What I ExpectedI was quite pleased with the condition of this book as well as its hardcover and the footnotes definitions and reading reviews for beginner readers of the genre I am of course a huge fan of the Scarlet Letter itself and this copy served its purpose well One of the few disappointments was that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral or pink than scarlet or red Also the back cover is white and I am most definitely one for appearances I would have like a slightly more classic looking cover Nonetheless the binding will look fair on my bookshelf Over all the book was clean and well taken care of and was shipped to me with great haste A Good Buy"
"2","GrippingThis novel is an Opera pure and simpleGranted it is not the easiest novel to read and Hawthorne can be slightly repetitive with the metaphors similes and analogies that sometimes go on for several lines Not to mention you could probably read half of each chapter and still keep up with the plotNonetheless the themes are so strong it is no wonder The Scarlett Letter has been deemed a classic The story tackles the issues of how one deals with hisher sins and how honesty for some comes at the price of great shameThe novel does take patience but it moves along at a very neat pace Had the novel been written with more scenes and less exposition it could have been even more grippingI read the Readers Digest edition which comes with about 12 lovely illustrations which capture the essence and the mood of the novel So that was nice eye candyLook out for the last three chapters talk about a falltothe floor clutchingattheheart climax its all here BreathtakingEnjoy"
"2","Good read but hard to navigate ebookI have long wanted to read this book by Nathaniel Hawthorne It was one of the first books I downloaded when I got my kindle 2 The character portrayals are superb It analyses the thoughts motivations strengths and weaknesses of the four major characters in the story Hester Prynn the vengeful doctor the hapless minister and Hesters vivacious and elflike daughter Pearl The description of the little girl and how she copes with being ostracized with her mother by a rigid puritanical society is especially moving While there are some descriptions of nature that are quite vivid most of the text goes into developing these four characters and is a fascinating psychological study though at times its little slowOverall a wellcrafted story and a good readThe book though is hard to navigate on the kindle because it has no active table of contents I therefore would not purchase this version at regular price Luckily its free"
"2","Why 5 stars Because theres no 6thA friend of mine called this book ponderous she read it in 8th grade Go back to this one I keep returning to it myself Maybe its in response to my parents divorce And how Hawthorne handles adultery not the danger and desire but the punishment and crime Hesters story begins outside the jail house An American sex crime Read it as such Trust Dover for a good cheap reprint"
"2","love itBook is a great read Intriguing from start to finish Cant find anything wrong to say Would reccomend for beginer to advanced readers"
"2","remembered from High School eons agoI purchased a Kindle because I am having surgery on both hands and this was one of the first items I downloaded I have enjoyed reading it again and look forwaed to other free classics from the Kindle store way to go Amazon"
"2","A ClassicI loved this book in high school and I love it now A tale of a strong woman that doesnt let society bring her down"
"1","TyposThe most irritating part about reading this book is the typos The book is already difficult to read with Hawthornes prolix writing I had to check with a different edition of The Scarlet Letter just to confirm whether or not it was a typo Also it would have been nice to have some footnotes like other editions do"
"2","Decent book but definately not Hanry David TheraouIt was a good book to read given that is a classical in American literature but I much rather like Theraous book Walden"
"1","BoringI tred to enjoy this novel In fact I battled through to about halfway hoping it would get better but it seemed to me a silly pretentious novel The history of life in that era was mildly enjoyable but I applaud anyone who had enough tenacity to stay the whole journey"

"2","The scarlet LetterThe book was wonderful and in good condition I purchased it for my daughter who is in highschool The book arrived around the time it stated it would Above all of that the price was great"
"1","Review From One Book At A TimeI hate giving classics bad reviews This book was not for me Nothing captured my attention and I found that I had to force myself to read it If it had been any longer I would have stopped It did catch my interest a little in the end but not enough to redeem the book in any way"
"2","Amazingly GoodI came up to this book a reading assignment for school with a bit of dread having heard that Hawthornes writing could be hard to read Actually it was a delightful suprise to find it was a captivating plot very well written and very easy to read I enjoyed it thoroughly This book is about a woman who has an affair choosing to bear the scarlet letter than reveal her lovers identity Along side her is her ilegitamate daughter a delightfully and hillariously strange character in the book The scarlet letter is a good book having a melancholy but redeeming ending A definate classic Check it out itll be better than you expected"
"2","interesting bookthough Im not a native english speaker I didnt find it difficult to read it It clearly represents a period in american history which probably many would like to forget about Sorry for high school students who couldnt understand it something needs to be done in order to improve their reading comprehension and interest in their own culture"
"1","Not my idea of a good readIve read worse But it takes a lot of mental energy to wade through all the commas and figure out the point of each paragraph It seems a lot longer than 240 pages I wouldnt have read it if I hadnt been forced to by the school And the introductory thing is torture"
"1","Good book to read if you were bored to deathI read this book over the summer because I had no time to go to a library or a bookstore and I had gotten to book for my birthday from my aunt back in May I usually read ALL the time If its a good book I can read it in less than 1 day Sometimes it even takes me 12 hours But this book took me 3 weeks I couldnt believe how long it took me Then it turns out that I have to read it this year in school UGH Please dont read this book only if you love very old books that are very hard to understand"
"2","A well written bookThe Scarlet Letter was an great book in that it kept me reading It was not boring It had sense to it It has alot of symbols in it that makes sense and has a purpose instead of just being there"
"1","The Scarlett Letter is too verboseI had to read The Scarlett Letter for my honors english 3 class I found that the author was too verbose in describing people places situations and just the story in general The book was so wordy I often found myself forgetting the topic of that particular paragraph Also I was disturbed to find out that ever day the Reverand A Dimmesdale would beat himself and stay up till the early morning hours"
"1","Bad BookThis is from a students point of view Im not a reader type so this book for me was awful I can see how people might like it the storyline is great all the themes and everything but the thing about this book that turned it down for me was Hawthornes style Coming from a time where authors get paid by the word lets just say it takes him AGES to get his point across"
"1","Duller than dirtI teach high school English and was required to teach thisto my students I dont know who suffered more me or themTo be fair as one of Americas first novels it has interestingelements and Hawthorne does a good jobOn the other hand it is excruciating to read There is nosuspense little to sympathize or empathize with and evenless to enjoy A better writer could have told the samestory in half the number of pages Some have labelledthis book a tragedy they are right only in the sense thatit is tragically bad"
"1","I must saythat I dont like this book I read it in high school when all I did and still do was read everything I could get my hands on I love literature I am even majoring in creative writing in college I UNDERSTOOD the book what it was trying to say the plot etc I just thought it didnt do a very good job of saying what it was trying to say It was unnecessarily vague what is the reason behind trying to confuse somebody wordy highflown and just too big The story could have been told more effectively as a short story even half the length I dont reccommend"
"1","too hard to followthe way the characters in this book speak makes it too dificult to follow along i tried to follow along but too boaring also the book is mainly based on her thoughts there is not a lot of human interaction with the main character"
"1","Historically accurate it may be but a boring readI read this Classic novel for a class and must admit I was thoroughly disappointed Hawthorne should have stuck to writing nonfictional books about the Puritan settlers This book was a pill There are so many American authors and novels that could be taught in schools that could far exceed the entertainment level of this out of date story Two thumbs down"
"2","Wonderful classicI enjoy this book very much It is a timely classic with which I am happy to now have my own copy"
"2","Worth the effortI have read this book twice now once in high school and now again in my 50s it is as pertinent now as it was when it was written It was difficult read but the more I got into the book the easier it became The old English language is so extinct but beautiful and worth reviving I plan to read it again in my 80s and I know I will see it in a completely different light I recommend Cliff Notes to help navigate the language and themes"
"2","Puritanical ostracismEasy A explains it best If you cant relate in some way you must be a robot Greatest book ever"
"1","Wasted TimeThere is absolutely nothing captivating about this novel Throughout the novel only 3 major events occur one in the beginning one in the middle and one at the end The characters are flat and difficult to relate to Overall the book was decent at best and could have been completed in no more than 50 pages or so Hawthornes writing is totally ridiculous He goes on and on stating irrelevant details and fills page after page with unnecessary imagery These pages consist of long paragraphs some which encompass multiple pages If I didnt have to read this for class I definitely would not have read it on my own Im not saying that it is a difficult novel but it is an unpleasant one In the end if you are looking to read great American novels skip over this one and go read some Steinbeck or Twain"
"2","TragicBeautifully descriptive tragic story Little pearl was the most captivating character in my opinion Good read would recommend to Jane Austen fans"
"2","GreatGreat American classic that you can get for free on kindle I was supposed to read this back in high school but wasnt not interested at the time But now with the benefit of age I can really appreciate it"
"2","Its niceits nice Very nice Good indeed I like it Nathaniel Hawthorne Exciting Yes Do you agree Hester Dimmesdale Pearl Chillingworth"
"2","Classic taleLoved this book as well The movies as always stray from the book I was pleasantly surprised and taken in by all the characters"
"2","A Classic Worth ReadingMy son had to read this for school and ended up really liking the story It opened up dialog with us his parents about social situations opinions and moralityI asked him about this review and he chose the review title and star rating"
"1","DO NOT READ THIS BOOKPlease I beg of you if you have any respect for your own time whatsoever DO NOT READ THIS BOOK Maybe if a couple of generations completey ignore it it will cease to be a socalled classic First of all it is written in pretty difficult language That is all fine and good if the book is worth the effort but this one definitely is not The author has no knowledge of subtlety and his message is both wrong I believe and poorly conveyed The second star is given only because his use of language is sometimes impressive but I would sooner read a taudry romance novel than reread The Scarlet Letter"
"2","My favorite classicAnybody who enjoys a book should read and keep The Scarlet Letter in their library Its a classic mustown for anybody that values the concept of reading And if you didnt like it the first time read it again and give it a second chance Ive read it about six times and it gets better each time Cherish this book"
"2","Scarlet Letter reviewHavent finished the book but love it Little Pearl is my favorite character The language is a little unfamiliar but very descriptive and eloquent Recommend for anyone interested in religiosity of colonial times"
"2","Excellent romance in an excellent editionHawthornes best work is central to understanding the trajectory of american culture from the Puritans to the moderns Still many of the books allusions will be cryptic to contemporary readers The footnotes and appendices make the book more available without all the weight of the Norton edition"
"2","The Scarlet Letter is a really good piece of LiteratureI thought that The Scarlet letter was a great piece of Literature and was a brave step for Hawthorne to take in this book during the time he wrote it I would definatly recommend this to other readers"
"1","Terrible book do not read itHawthornes dull prose really gets to you after a while The book is filled with antiquated language and is basically an account of a Puritan woman who suffers because of her adultery I was forced to read this book for my English class and it was a terrible waste of time Hawthorne hits you in the face with run on sentences that take up the entire page I do have one good thing to say about this book however for all you insomniacs out there read it It induces sleep in minutes ZzZzZzZzZzZz"
"1","Meaningless DrivelI stongly dislike this book There is too much meaninglessness to it I can read seven pages for something that can be stated in one paragraphits awful Only Webster would be able to read this and not use a dictionary I have understood two chapters I dont see why an English teacher would like this book because it is full of empty sentences It is hard for one to read this book without his mind wandering As I stated before this is not my kind of book"
"1","Worst Book EverIt is my invariably correct opinion that the socalled author responsible for this overly extravagant and flamboyant style of writing should be dragged into the street and summarily executed with EXTREME prejudice for crimes against humanity and the English language"
"1","Who Chooses ClassicsI dont see how this book gets so much attention as being one of the best novels ever Its very short and very boring Its written in old english which adds to the difficulty and even if you can understand it you finish the book and say Ok so whats the point There is absolutely no point to this novel Entire chapters of the novel are void of dialogue and appears as a wall of text and the description is so vague that you cant even tell what a character is doing half the time"
"1","Hallelujah is what I said when I finished this bookThis novel was the most boring book I have ever read I would never put another person through the torture of reading this longwinded dull attempt at a scandalous and exciting romance Even though there is much symbolism to be found when is one supposed to find it while they are sleeping Another factor of my displeasure with this book is that I love to read and now hesitate to pick up another Hawthorne piece How did this book become a CLASSIC"
"2","a must readEveryone needs to read this classic An amazing look into the piousness of the early settlers I really appreciated it a lot"
"2","Teachers This is not his best novelAny Hawthorne work including this one shows why the author remains one of the most celebrated in American literature As to subject matter kids are more receptive to the likes of The House of the Seven Gables Perhaps adults would be too if they hadnt been forcefed The Scarlet Letter complete with the Customs House filler in high school Lest the reader find this teacher cynical note the five stars I also have a dog named Hawthorne and had another named Prynne"
"2","Very good and very unlike the movieI am an avid reader specially of books in the English language The movie The Scarlet Letter has been a favorite of mine but reading other reviews of the novel other editions here in Amazon prompted me to read it People kept saying they were dissapointed with the movie and vice versa people kept saying they could not deal with Hawthornes 19th century language But I could deal perfectly with the idiom even though its not my first language Both the movie and the novel are excellent although different"
"1","not kindle readyIts hard to put together any nice words about this transcription It is not kindle ready although it is textually complete Should be a freebie"
"2","goodthis book seemed to take awhile to get to me but it still came within the specified time frame so alls well I guess and the condition of the book was quite acceptable"
"1","Boring veryThis book may have been one of the best books of the 19th century but its language and themes dont relate to us very much any more The Scarlet Letter is very boring and never seems to end I really disliked the book"
"1","BoringMy english teacher assigned this book one I would never read on my own I am a 16 year old and I enjoy reading But this book while it does have a few good points and messages is incredibly dull The points are hard to get and I only understood the points after we had discussed them in class While this book has a rather good story its concealed by endless symbols and references I suggest the cliff notes version"
"1","Really Hard to FollowThis is another classic out in the book world but I find it extremely hard to follow Hawthorne had a lot of good points in the book but I didnt understand them until they were pointed out to me If you dont get into that Puritan time period of literature then I suggest you dont read it There is a lot of symbolism in this book too"
"2","A fascinating look into another times moresOf course this is a classic of American literature and to my mind with good reason The story engages and puts one in the time It requires a modern reader to stretch but the exercise rewards"
"1","One word outdatedThis book is one of the last masterpieces written as American literature moved from what we call Old English use the much cliched Olde if you must to New English And trust me it shows Virtually every book ever written during this period essentially before Twains Huckleberry Finn bears the same markings incredibly lavish diction complex structure and syntax and all the elements that make for a generally hard to follow novel If you elevate your reading to that next level where youre seeing beyond the simple plot and percieving Hawthornes masterful use of symbolism and metaphor and are able to appreciate probably the last great novel written in before the literary revival of the late 1800s then youll consider this book a worthwhile read"
"1","I was fored to read it tooThe Scarlet Letter is a good but long and discriptive book I wouldnt tell anybody to read it unless they classic books or a Hawthorne fan This book and also The House of The Seven Gables are based on the one unlying rule of Hawthorne description His books wouldnt be so long if he would have just gotton to the plot Now dont get me wrong the plot to this book was good but the movie is even better If you have to read it just deal with it All I know is that is didnt hold my attenion very long and I fell asleep a couple of times"
"1","a tragedyThis is a tragedy in two ways Everyone dies at the end and if you have to or choose to read this you will experience a tragedyI can compare this book to a lobsterPeople say lobsters are a delecacy and you have to get through a shell to get to the meatThis book is a classic and you have dissect each and every sentence to get a general understandingAvoid this book at all costs if you have to read it in school then you are better off faking a concusion"
"1","too had to readI find the old english wording too hard to understand and too hard to readhavent got into it too far yet but it is taking me forever to get here"
"1","Simply the worse book everI had to read this book for my high school English class I hated every bit of it actually I never finished it This book does not belong on the list of classic must reads As a college student now I thought I would give the book a second chance just as something to read for my own personal joy of reading This is still to this day the WORSE book I have ever read in my life How could anyone actually like this back enough to rate it 3 star much less 5 This should be rated in negative stars"
"1","No Active Table of ContentsMy rating is only for the electronic formatting of this book I really feel like I dont have any right to complain since the book was free but you get what you pay forThe book starts with an introduction to the story which goes on for 18 of the book file The actual text of the book doesnt start until location 60410 Unfortunately the only way to find this is to page through from the beginning It would have been nice to have a table of contents or at least a bookmaark for the start of the actual book"
"1","Should not be a requirement in high schoolTo me this book would turn a young person like my self away from the key and enjoyment of reading Being a book with extensive mistakes in it it is very difficult to read unless you are to inerpret it every paragraph or should I say sentence It maybe a classic but I feel that the word classic comes from just being oldps the only reason I put a star was because I had to to express my opinion on he novel"
"1","It was like a bad dream but I couldnt wake upThis book is like a bad soap No action No drama Very predictable It is about a woman who cheated on her husband with another man The baby dad is the preacher Why the couple couldnt have gotten a divorce is beyond me And the writing is horrible Maybe Webster would have fun with this book but not a high schooler being forced to read it Reading this is like a punch in the testicles it HURT This book is hell on earth Dont read it By the way I had to give it one star"
"1","Landscape bookI guess I should have read the last review or even the fact that the description says Landscape I didnt think it was necessary its just a book rightI guess its supposed to be easier to read in bed I just thought it would be cool to have the Scarlet Letter be a red bookIf you buy this book you will be holding the book like a wall calendar and reading in two columns first the two columns on the top page and then two columns on the bottom This just seems really irritating to me"
"2","THE SIMPLE CONCEPT OF SIN TABOOTHIS BOOK IS A GREAT CLASSIC THAT EXPLOITS THE IDEA THAT A PREACHER WOULD DO THE UNTHINKABLE AND MAKE A WOMAN PREGNANT WHO HE WAS NOT MARRIED TO THE SPIRIT IS WILLING BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK I LIKE THE CANDID REALITY OF THIS BOOK THAT DID NOT WHITEWASH EVERYTHING COMPLETELY AND THE STORY STILL MAKES SENSE IN THE MODERN WORLD THIS STILL HAPPENS EVEN TO THIS DAY HOWEVER THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IS THE WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT TO DO"
"2","Excellent giftMy 12 year daughter was delighted to receive the Scarlet Letter She has enjoyed reading it through out Xmas vacation I had forgotten how good literature can be an excellent gift"
"2","Great classic for the priceFor a first time reading of this classic I recommend this If you love it you may want a nicer version for the bookshelf This is a nice quality book though The printing isnt too small and neither is the book It fits right in my paperback bookshelf perfectly with others just like itAnd as for the story I could go on many pages Just do a few searches for reviews its a classic that will outlive all of us and has a lot to say about human beings and our culture past and futureOne of the best Classics great one to get started on or to read over and over again"
"1","Missing Custom HouseMy daughter needed this book for school and specifically needed an edition with the custom house We looked inside this book on line and it shows that it includes the custom house When the book arrived it did not include the custom house Very disappointed as we took the time to check and she needed this for class"
"2","Incredibly engrossingI absolutely loved this book it was so engrossing could not put it down Hawthorne has wonderful descriptions it is a fascinating time in history and he brings it alive A flawless book"
"1","Characterization in The Scarlet LetterThe Scarlet Letter is overloaded with many superfluous words that requires the reader to sift through them all to get to the actual story However the strong characters are revealed through their actions more than through Hawthornes descriptions The story takes place in 17th Century Boston and Puritanical Law is heavily enforced A young woman Hester has been imprisoned for getting pregnant while committing adultery Now that the baby is 3 months old they have her stand in the center of town with so she can be shamed by the whole town Her husband just happens to come to town as she stands on the scaffold and thus the story continues in a dark spiral of hidden friendships revenge immense guilt and sin This story is a historical fiction told 200 years later and is full of symbolism and the ironies of human nature and society The ending was rather abrupt as if Hawthorne was on a writing deadline and got tired of his own story"
"2","the illiteracy of our generationFrankly in reading the negative reviews it is clear to me that there is a growing body of illiterates among us It seems too that the more a book makes one think the more negaive review it receives from some readersI do agree that this particular Kindle edition is cumbersome to navigate due to the format but it is still an exceptional book and very worth reading Not only is the character developmet quite thorough and enjoyable but it gives us a glimpse of the society in which it was written What I always find fascinating is that this like most other classics is about human nature power and the consequences of actions So in the end these themes are enduring and feed our desire to look into the hearts and souls of others to be voyeurswhich is what makes a classic a classic"
"2","The Scarlet Letter eBookGreat book had seen the movie but the book is much more It will hold your attention and is an easy read tooEven better the ebook was free on Amazon"
"1","I just dont get itI am an avid reader I have read many so called classics This book is just plain boring Yawn I really tried to get into it I couldnt finish it I just kept falling asleep This book contains some seriously long sentences Some readers have said to just skip the first chapter or so I couldnt do that It just seems wrong If you are going to read a book you should try and read it all I am sorry to say I have not read the Scarlet Letter Sorry Hawthorne I really really tried"
"2","favorite classicloved it in high school love it as an adultGreat book and very informativeBook is written well with ability to keep the reader interested in the book and all it has too offerCharacters and other plot"
"1","Childish NovelIt is a travesty that this novel is even classified with the classics This is by far one of the most boring and pointless novels in existance The plot dribbles on about sin and adultry with few arguments The contrasting of light and dark with shadows light and color is overdone and quite childish Any third grade student can classify purity as light and sin as darkness More over there is over a hundred pages of belaboring the point with no real conclusion At the end of the novel all I had was a headache and I had fallen asleep more than a dozen times"
"1","Jeff the ScornedI hated this story It was long It was preachy It was boring Unless youre interested in catching up on battles with Puritanism avoid this book"
"1","UghI read this book for AP English and had to do a bluebook assignment of it The word ugh summarizes my experienceThis book was written in the 19th century and thats where it belongs It wouldnt be nearly as bad if someone were to modernize the language used in the book but reading through dost thou after dost thou isnt any funHowever I highly recommend reading Richard Armours take on SL in his book The Classics Reclassified"
"1","This book was dumbI know that saying the book is dumb nullifies all the hard work put into it but I just did not like it Sure the main idea and a well written summary makes the book as a whole good it doesnt help the actual context one bit which was very hard to follow and comprehend"
"1","Avg Rating too highIve bought this book underlined every hint of symbolism found all evidence of romanticism followed every quote involving thematic oppositions and noted every example of Pearls rebellious nature and social alienation but I cannot find one positive aspect of this novel that makes any of my hard work feel rewarding The only way this novel could give me a warm feeling is if I place it in a furnace"
"1","Received a different bookI ordered a specific ISBN No and received a different tiny book of the same with different appearence and a different ISBN NoThe picture seen online is not the one that I received"
"1","Oh myThis novel is absolutely awful Although it has received over 500 reviews I feel it is my duty to help bring the average star level to where it belongs at zero Where to begin perhaps with the run on sentences the failure to create significant rising action the flat two dimensional characters This novel is full of things which not only bore the reader but frustrate them as wellThe fatal flaw in this piece of literature is its inability to stay relevant Postmodern society does not really care about Baby daddies and the revelation which is made at the end and beginning of this novel is reproduced daily on morning television a la Maury Unfortunately Nathaniel Hawthorn you are the father of this literary disaster"
"1","Far too little crime and fist fightsSo I heard about this from a friend at ComiCon He did not know much about it but heard some people talking about it in the food court I thought it sounded awesome like Read or Die meets a cross between The Green Lantern and The Crimson Crusader So I order what I thought was the graphic novel turns out it is more novel and less graphic It was nothing like I expected and unless shame is a super power which is unlikely Hester is just some puritan lady before radioactive spiders even existedSeriously I dont think BANG POW or ZORT show up anywhere in the book I almost gave this one star but Roger Chillingworth is an awesome super villain name His physiognomy is dead on as well like in all comics it lets us know he is the clear bad guy and we should not relate to him at all Since the bad guy at least fits what I expect this gets 2 stars"
"1","Get to the point alreadyToo long Reread this and remembered how much Hawthornes style irritates me There is an interesting story within but he takes WAY too long to tell it"
"1","Slow moving predictable storyThe story is a very simple one but the action so to speak doesnt really happen until the final third of the book It was a battle to get through the dry middleUnfortunately the story is also exceptionally easy to guessand the turns of the story are not surprising in the leastOn the plus side the book gives a good glimpse at life in Puritan early American communities and their moral strucutres"
"2","Good book if you look into itThe Scarlet Letter is not a dull book if you get into it It is true that its language can be hard to read and understand at times but that does not make it uninteresting The main story may not be considered exciting but the novel is full of literary elements that make it a good book Several faults are pointed to in this perfect Puritain town in which the story takes place The book uses good elements like foreshadowing foil characters and a lot symbolism A main point of the book is Hesters admiting her guilt as compared to her lovers hiding his guilt Im not going to tell you who she had the affair with but it will be soon figuared out when you see the signs of his scarlet letter The book may not be as exciting as some but dont let this keep you from reading it because it really is good"
"2","GreatREAD ME READ ME READ MECall me a sucker for classics well I am This novel brings forth issues that are still with us today Yes the book was written over 100 years ago but it deals with Single mothers in a twoparent society and how the outsiders to the situation townspeople deal with Hestor Prynne and her daughter Pearl Even today we seem to look down upon single mothers as nothings even though they are doing the best they can to raise their children and to survive themselves Nathaniel Hawthorne seems to be writing about not only the early settlers but also about HIS time and OUR time all in the same book I give it five stars because of its beautiful discription of the trials and tribulations of singleparenthood"
"1","Horrific forced readingI will never understand why they force this book on school children Im sure there are many other classic stories that could be included in the curriculum"
"1","I read to pages of this novel and I had to stopI have yet to actually complete this novel It is so doggone hard to understand On top of this I have an essay that is due TOMORROW Is there no relief"
"1","I dont get itI was assigned this book when I was a sophomore in high school 22 years ago I couldnt get through it the Cliff Notes version help me pass the test I found it turgid and laborious readingI graduated in the top 10 of my high school class I have a masters degree Despite my academic success I dont understand why this book is a classic I dont understand why Hester didnt just pack up Pearl and her stuff move to another town and tell everyone she was a widow That would have saved everyone alot of grief especially young readers like me"
"1","I hate this bookThis is the worst book I have ever read The attempts at symbolism are bogged down with unnecessary detail and the language is over the top even for the time period I hurled it across the room at one point in agitation and disgust"
"2","its as if I were reading the book itselfI got the auido book cuz I didnt have time to read the book for my english report and exam I listen to it for one week and did a great book report and did great on the final exam I did better listen than reading"
"1","Way too boring for meMy son was forced to read this book for his high school english class I consider this cruel and unusual punishment I believe there are some consitutional laws that prevent schools from giving kids this big slop of boring inside about 300 pages Its the reason why kids these days hate reading because before they have time to read anything exciting and interesting they have to read stuff like the Scarlet Letter The only reason Nathaniel Hawthorne is a classic is because he wrote fancy and he is dead In fact Hawthorne never wrote an interesting word in his life Its like he went out of his way to bore people to death Now I know there wasnt much around to inspire good stories back than but I didnt think it was this bad He drags on a plot that shouldnt of lasted more than 30 pages into a whole freakin novel Pure insanity that kids are forced to read terrible bore fests like Hawthorne"
"1","Great plot horrible writingI believe that the plot of The Scarlet Letter could have been wonderful something I would love to read because the events are all such interesting ideas I just think that Mr Hawthorne made them boring through his writing style Sometimes it just dragged on forever I really think more of the book consisted of descriptions than dialogueI couldnt enjoy a book like that I think if this was written by a different author with mainly the same plot it could be wonderful But this was terribly boring"
"1","get it awayI usually have nothing to say but good things about book I read But this book it does have its interesting points but I just dont get into it I rather would burn myself at the stake that read the remaining chapter I have to finish for my English Class What did I have to do to deserve this I stood there reading the book with my book in one hand and dictionary in the other I ended up reading Chapter 9 about 10 times because the information wasnt getting to me And the way the author addresses the reader I want to scream Im sure in the 1850s this was a wonderful book because of the message it stated back then but more than 100 years afterwards people seem to lose interest And the fact that they make HS students read this book is just plain homicide STOP THE ASSIGNING OF THIS BOOK DONT PUT YOUR STUDENTS THROUGH TORTURE"
"1","Overrated Pretentious TrashThis novel is widely regarded as overrated The plot is not that interesting the writing style is torturousthe plot twists are predictable Its a typical example of pre20th century bad writing Not to say that any book from that era is crap but this book certainly is"
"2","The Scarlet LetterOne ofthe greatest novels in all of literature The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne tells of a life vastly different from those that we live today Rejecting the present permissive lifestyle to which we were accustomed the reader is entrenched in the gloom and doom of Puritan society It is an exposure to a law that tells what to wear how to think and whom to love The Scarlet Letter is a story of law versus human nature hypocrisy and of undeniable passionsEnlightening and refreshing the reader is taken on an adventure and fully understands the risks of living passionately beyond the limits that society sets A novel that can be enjoyed by all ages The Scarlet Letter is a masterpiece of its time"
"2","A classic novel with a contemporary messageHawthornes masterpiece is beautifully written and skillfully constructed Its message is subtle yet pervasive that people we punish as sinners are often far more noble than their punishers Judge not lest ye be judged Best or worst of all the story is still wonderfully applicable to contemporary life Perhaps President Clinton ought to wear a big scarlet letter A on his chest for the rest of his term"
"2","Each read is like peeling layers of a roseWhat greater journey than to delve into the human heart Every emotion one can nurture there is here bared and examinedHester at once forthright and complex serves as our guide as she wanders the lambrynth of her own private neartThat we can fall sin disappoint and still find redemption in confession make the message of The Scarlet Letter a most comforting tract for out day"
"2","A better read as an adult not a great choice for teenagersWellpaced surprisingly easy to follow despite the language used I hadnt read it in 30 years and found it to be much more palatable as an adult than it was when I was a teenager There must be a lesson in there somewhere"
"1","Dont pay for this on the KindleUnless you have the correct size font you will have a difficult time reading this book on the Kindle It is not set up to have the text wrap correctly and therefore has a full line of text the next line has a single word then another full line and so on"
"2","Strong Woman200300 worddI really liked this book because of Hester She was a protagonist who refused to obey by socetys rules She is a role model for women who wish to be free Sure she made a mistake But dont we all Adultery is not right but we learn from mistakesI really liked to read about the time period because it was so different from our own It is hard to believe that Hawthorne was only a writer for his time period"
"1","Slow Overwritten DramaIt started with a great plotuntil he actually wrote it It was overwritten it takes pages before something happens and the protagonists were hard to like Boring sappy novel written as if he trying to imitate Victorian prose There are a couple twists but the main characters are such morons it underscores the little action that does happen"
"1","Great Story Bad writingSo sue me I just dont like Nathanial Hawthorne I think the plot is brilliant but I find his method of telling the story annoying Im afraid this isnt an assertion I can back up with a lot of concrete examples its just that his writing gives me a vague feeling of malaise I find this true of his short stories as well so I never bothered with the other novels But youll have to read The Scarlet Letter for school anyway so borrow it from the library"
"2","Wonderful wonderfulThank you Erika Vause for your positive review I absolutely love this book I had heard of this novel but never considered reading it because the plot simply did not interest me Then we read it in our academic English class 10th graders and I was absolutely astonished Not only by the magnificence of the bookits themes of guilt and redemption are powerful and heart wrenchingbut by the ignorance of some of my peers It was obvious that their dislike sprung from the fact that they did not understand it Please pleaseread this book You will not be sorry I promise"
"1","AwfulIll admit right up front that I am stupid I would rather enjoy a book instead of try to find my way through the maze of confusing endless prose that Hawthorne uses I found myself empathizing more with Chillingworth than Dimmesdale A book should NOT have to be dissected and disscussed to be understood It should clearly portray its thematic structure without having to resort to a smokescreen of vague symbols and the word Classic stamped all over it to force people to appreciate it Yes it was heavily thematic and full of symbolism and it was meaty whatever that is deep and powerful but it was dry slow and boring Even someone as myself who generally enjoys the classics will fall asleep as I did everytime I tried to read this book Do NOT try to speedread this This book has no place in a highschool English course it needs a span of several years to muddle and plod thru and then try to unravle"
"1","So boringI am an English teacher and getting through the book was tough Only Nathaniel Hawthorne can make sex sound boring"
"1","The okay bookHawthornes The Scarlet letter is an okay book It has an okay plot and okay characters but the book is not one for teens of the 90s I had to read this book for my English teacher and to tell the truth if it were not graded I would not have read it The teens of today do not want to read about the ancient customs of puritan society If it had been about the scandalous affairs of Hester and Rev Dimmsdale it would still be a best seller I think this book should be only read voluntarily If you are thinking of reading it you may need to reconsider"
"1","I HATE THIS BOOKIm sure I would be able to understand the vivid descriptions and symbolism in this book much better if Hawthorne were not writing in some sort of moon man language I dont know about the production of narcotics in the 1800s but I honestly think that Hawthorne wasnt on a natural high if you know what Im saying"
"1","Dont READ THIS BOOKTHIS BOOK SUX Who cares about Pearl anyways Someone shoot me in the head before i die of boredom"
"1","If your looking to fall asleep than this is perfect 4 you Well im 15 years old and my english teacher assigned this book for the class I read only 6 of the chapters and then gave up Maybe if it was somewhat interesting I would read it but it has nothing to do with modern lifeAnd to assign such a book at this time in a teens life is just pointless Like I really care about what happenes to Hester Ive failed all the quizzes that my teacher gave us and most kids from the class did the same Its one of those books where you read 4 pages and all of a sudden you realized that you were thinking about what you wearing today Then i have to read the pages all over again The book is extremely boring I do not recommend it"
"1","slowly falling asleepThe book is boring if you try to read it without a good look at the movie first but it gets easier to understand once youre in class failing every single test your teacher gives you on it Then she decides to explain whats going on to you later It was boring and I fell asleep everytime I went to read it"
"1","one of the worst books Ive ever readtypically I will force myself to read even the worst books for class for fun because I think I should but when I read this book for a English course I quickly realized it was one of the worst books ever not to be taken lightly seriously certainly not worthy of a classic boring endless details that no one cares about blah blah blah Terrible I was bored It might have been too difficult for a 9th grader but I wouldnt read it now eitheron the other hand my brother loved it"
"1","I only gave it a star because I had toThis was the worst book I ever read I was lost and confused and that was only in the first sentence You would think that classic had to have some level of goodness but this book was the worst piece of filth I had ever read in my entire life Its no wonder that Hawthorn locked himself in his mothers attic he was mentally ill before he ever wrote the book If you are a high school studentlike I am you know the hell that I had to go through and I am guessing you never want to put yourself through it again And to you who have no read this book dont You have not or never will commit enough sin to be put in to the type of hell that this book offers the reader DO NOT READ THIS BOOK Oh and by the way who decided that this was a classic romantic book there is nothing romantic about this novel nor anything good If you are in the mood for a good romance shoot for Nora Roberts or Sandra Brown they can actually write"
"1","paralyzing fearThe pain brought on by this archaicly verbose peice of literary kindling is so great that while reading I was greatly tempted to gouge out my eyes to prevent any future encounters with Mr Hawthornes work Please for the love of all things sacred USE CLIFFNOTES It will save you from years of therapy I am scarred for live My soul will be tormented after death and i will be forced to walk the earth in search for reconciliation"
"1","A sin to humanityNo Im not talking about Hesters crime Im talking about this STUPID BOOK If only Hawthorne had kept his job in the customs house see prologue this abomination would never have been spawned from the cessridden depths of Hawthornes twisted thinking organ You can figure THAT out on your own This book is untolerably boring the only proven cure of insomnia if you dont mind the side effects and the descriptions are ridiculously entangling In the words of Mr Hawthorne himself this book is ignominiously dull PRESERVE YOUR SANITY NEVER READ THIS NEVERI sleep now"
"1","forced to read the most horrible book everwhere to bloody begin ah in my junior year i and everyone else in class was forced to read the book and watch the horrible origanal slow and boring movie after we got done with it almost everyone in the whole dang room yelled out that it suck right at the same time both this and the great gatsby sucked but i dd surprisngly enjoyed the great gatsby movie towards the end of it"
"1","This book is a wast of good paperOh man where do i begin with this one First of all I want to say that a 1 star rating is flattering this novel beyond all means The Scarlett Letter is one of the most boring pieces of junk that I have ever been assigned to read I realize that there is a ton of symbolism in this novel but if you cant stay awake to find it whats the point Also it really helps when Hawthorne decides to use 15 letter words in each and every sentence Only person that I would recommend this novel to is an insomnia patient This one ranks right up there with A Tale Of Two Cities another Classic"
"2","scarlet letterthis novel is of course set in england in the eighteeth centuryher a young woman jailed for crimes she commted outside themarriage was branded with a scarlett letter over her bossomthis was tipical of the ear and time"
"1","LooooooooooooooooongIf you can read and readily understand oldenglish you may be able to enjoy this novelI found it painfully long and didnt even care to finish it which is unheard of for me"
"1","Unable to ReviewUnfortunately I have to say that I am very very disappointed with this order I ordered this book on Sept 2 for my daughter to read and write a report about for school Report is due Oct 25 and to date October 9 I have NOT RECEIVED it yet When I contacted the vendor to report last week I basically received a sorry for your luck but once it leaves our hands we really dont care type of response Totally not impressed"
"1","PainfulThis was one of the most boring books ive ever read Unfortunately i did not give up on Hawthorne after reading this novel that was a mistake Id pass on this one if i were you if you must read this for school I highly suggest getting a summary online"
"1","Incredibly confusing have a dictionary on handThis is probably the most confusing and worst book I have ever read The author uses incredibly large words and you constantly have to use a dictionary or else you most likely wont know hat you are reading From my point of view as a high school with mostly As and good at English student I would not recommend this book to any other high school age students The author needs to get to the point and not drag on for pages about things that are not important at all Long setences also makes the book drag on If I didnt have to read this book for a book report I would have put it down after the first page or two and usually I finish every book that I start This book had me in tears because it was so difficult I had to ask my English teacher to explain this to me Read this book at your own risk but i do not reccommend it to anyone"
"1","Save YourselfI agree 100 that Hawthorne was a brillaint writer But this book was horrible A simple phrase of action Hester walking down the street would be 4 pages of reflection I read alot and am a huge fan of John Steinbeck JD Salinger Mark Twian I hated this book It was took long and nearly impossible to read If you have to read it for school good luck Otherwise avoid this There are much better classics than this"
"1","IckThree words to describe my feelings of this bookI HATE ITHawthornes writings are dull dry and other words that mean bad that start with D The characters a boring"
"2","confusing but goodBeing in high school it took a little bit to understand it but after a while I was able to get the basic point of the story If you know youll have to read this for school in the future read it ahead of time That way you wont be reading on a deadline which makes it worse Read it at your own pace and you will understand it more Also the second time through when you have to read it you will see many things that you missed and the story will be much more meaningful to you Youll do better on tests and quizzes too Even if youre not required to read it check it outits not called a classic for nothing"
"2","SADthis book represents a time in the past of our country in which we should be ashamed not only was this a time of witchcraft and witchunts but the society was willing to ostracize a human being for adultery as if it werent punishment enough for hester to have to wear the a on her chest everyone stared at her peculiarly and did not accept her into normal society i think this is overly harsh yet this whole book reflects the time in which it took place very well i would recommend it"
"1","The Next Best Thing to a Sleeping PillThis book literally put me to sleep I could wake up at 2 in the morning and find the book in my lap and then have to stress over finishing the assigned reading for my English class I mean some of the sentences are about 15 lines long and the plot if there is a plot is incredibly slow If the author would just tell it like it is and not drag it out for pages the book would be only about a third of the length that it is Boring boring BORING"
"2","greatIve never heard of this author before so reading this was a bit of a gamble with me but I liked the sound of it Well Im glad I took the risk I was sucked into the characters lives and anxious to discover thier outcomes and fates The plotline fell into place so well and wonderfully Despite the fact that it wasnt full of suspense it was still SUCH a page turner I loved the way the book was written each line meant something and each line was meant to be there and each new page was like a new poemIt made me concentrate too Its not the kind of book you can read half asleep before bed time this book required my full attention"
"2","Beautifully DoneThe story of hester is by itself a master piece worthy of its highly commended status however the annotated version really helps the reader understand the historical references and many archaic words"
"1","Not What it is Made Out to beIt shocks me that the Scarlet Letter is the most taught book in the nation It may have much symbolism and so on but it is a convoluted mess The author is completely detached from his audience and for some bizarre reason he feels he has to explain every little thing that happens in great detail It is also irrelevant to our modern times In our days people need to be reading things like Huxley Orwell Fitzgerald Bradbury Hemmingway Steinbeck Salinger and many other great 20th century writers This book is only relevant to those interested in the time period which it discusses"
"1","hate this new formatI didnt realize when I ordered it that the type was turned side ways I bought this as a gift but not sure I will give itI guess someone might like the format but I dont"
"2","WonderfulOnce you get past the language barrier this book is an amazing read To see the tragedies that some women went through at one point in history is a great thing and to remind us never to let history repeat itself"
"1","Need a dictionaryThe Scarlet Letter is an interesting book While reading the book I was filled with many feelings about it I enjoyed some chapters but loathed the ones describing the characters I felt as if Hawthorne could have told the story more efficiently if he had described each character as they came onto the scene The book made me feel inferior and uneducated I made so many trips to get the dictionary that my legs got tired I enjoyed the general storyline but I could have left the adjectives behind Pearl was my favorite character because she had a priceless intuition that helped me read the book I would have been lost without Pearls hints I would not have read this book if not required to by my English teacher Attack it if you dare"
"2","An Excellent Portait of Puritan New EnglandNathaniel Hawthornes The Scarlet Letter is a vivid and accurate portayal of life in Puritan New England The prejudices superstitions and institutions of the society are expressed so well that contemporary readers who have little knowledge of New Englands history are able to feel the oppression and religious pressures that were common in that society Indeed this work is comparable if not superior to Arthur Millers Crucible"
"1","Leave this one to the bibliophilesYes I am a 17 yr old high school kid But I can tell good books from the bad ones The Scarlet Letter is a classical tale of 2 lovers To be concise this novel is too wordy to be enjoyable People can say its a classic romantic novel it has good character developments it has good themes and ironies blah blah blah I like most people dont judge a book by checking out its trap metaphors all in all leave this book to a Doctor of Puritanical Philosophy If youre looking for a more entertaining classic read Huck Finn by Twain"
"1","Yes I was another victim who had to read this for schoolOk when I first started this book I thought it was the dumbest thing and I could not belive this was a classic I still cant After a few chapters I thought it was a little better and thats why I gave it two stars Also it is one of the better books that I had to read for school I still feel that it was a little boring and hard to follow but with the class discussions I understood it a lot more I still wouldnt reccommend this book to anyone"
"2","a book valueThe classic book that is read by virtually every high school student in America and at a bargian price"
"2","Good read Good read"
"1","Not interesting at allI was supposed to read this for English classand had some interest because Ive heard people and my teacher say that this was an American classic and was very goodBut once I heard some of my friends who started to read it and say it was difficult and boringI got the book on audio to assist meI only got to chapter 3 and I was trying to guess how many pages were left to the endIts uniteresting and difficult because the story wanders with absolutly no directionI highly recomend getting Cliff Noteswhich I got and are very easy to understand compared to the book and possibly the movieIt might not be the same to the book but having the visual aid of Demi Moore certainly helps the mind focus better"
"1","This book is incredibly boringThis is one of the alltime most boring books I do not recommend reading it at all The introduction is incredibly long and incredibly boring Also it doesnt really have the sort of plot that would make it a book you cant put down I personally fell asleep four different times reading this book I had much higher expectations for this book If you are looking for a classic to read I would recommend The Count Of Monte Cristo not this book"
"1","Both forward and backward in its ideasFirst of all those who found the book to be dull such as me listen to it on tape its abbreviated yet still dangerous boring to listen to while driving as I found out Indeed Hawthorne introduces some advanced ideas for the times such as writing about a single mother as well as musings about womens rights His obsession with Victorian themes such as the deification of children fixation on bodily sins as well as overdramatization and simplification of the plot equals predictability and annoyance to the reader While this book could probably be considered a classic such as Tolstoys Anna Karenina both are better classified as carefully crafted literary exercises rather than engaging stories"
"1","I am going to bring Hawthorne back from the grave to hit himAghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh this the worst book ive ever read I consider myself open to all fine lterature but I absolutely hate this book But the writing is superb"
"1","Not Worth ReadingYes the writing is poeticbut the book says the same thing over and over I didnt feel like I learned anything from reading this book the characters are rather flat and the symbols are far too obvious and there is too many of them Its like Hawrthorne had a contest with himself to see how many symbols he could cram in"
"2","Power to womenI read this book when I was 16 and I totally fell in love with it I love the power it hands over to women Hawthorne does a great job in illustrating the kind of prejudice society extends to women for actions that can be equally distributed to men but even more so he shows the determination of a woman to overcome whatever adversities may be present with renewed pride and dignity"
"1","it was very slowHawthorne was a excellent writer for the 19th century however this book is very slow and often has no dialog for over a chapter The descriptions get very long boring and tedious As you read this book your mind starts to wander and you cant remember what happened for chapters at a time The only was I was able to get through it was by reading Cliffs Notes then the book"
"1","It wasnt goodI starting reading this book with great enthusiasm for my 11th grade English GT classs summer homework I read and read and I just started hearing names of people who didnt make sense I could never figure out who Reverend whatever is or that other guy they talk about I just went a long skimming the book not able to feel any plot whatesoever I was completely bored with this book I didnt need a dictionary whatsoever either but I will probably need Cliff Notes so I could understand what the story is about if anyone can help please do"
"1","ughWhy do books such as this keep being required reading in high schools Havent there been any authors in more recent time that would provide students more relevancy Obviously this appeals to those who are truly literature loversand thats fantastic But for most kids give them something theyll enjoy reading and maybe theyll learn to love literature more Books like this just antagonize and demoralize those who are not naturally literature lovers"
"1","A classicbut one of the worst books everAt some point in your life you may have to read this snooze fest and I pity the day you are required to read it Hawthorne takes days to make a point any statement at all starting from the unbearable introduction The custom house through the last page There is no action no humor no joy only the character study of the puritan society and a brave woman Do yourself a favor and get the cliffnotes or use Antistudycom Anyone who truly believes this is a good is either a pseudointellectual or they enjoy the same style of Melville or anything written by Hawthorne I would give this no stars if possible"
"1","How Can Sex and Sin Be So BoringThroughout this entire book one part of my brain was in a state of wonder trying to imagine how anyone could make a book about scandal sin adultery public shame and cowardice so dull To finish the book was a test of will and was accomplished because I hate to leave things undoneThere are many fine engaging interesting novels both of our age and of Hawthornes I cant imagine why one would want to slog through this one"
"1","unfinishableA classic Hardly In its time this book may have ruffled feathers but these days its a struggle to get through Hawthornes writing style is dreary and dreadful if captivating readers was his aim he failed miserably"
"1","American classic my This completely predictable novel seems more like a beginners attempt of writing a book rather than an American classic The author treats the readers as if they completely lack a brain by stating the understood and by completely beating concepts to death note the reference"
"2","Hawthornes MasterpieceHawthornes Scarlet Letter is a tale of secret love adultery and sadness Every person should read this timeless American novel at some point in their life The strength of Hester Prynne is unusual for novels composed during the time this was published and is therefore a revolutionary literary work My only complaint is the length of The Custom House however horrible this sounds I would just skip it it does not add to the plot of the novel anyway"
"2","Useful for AP LitI read Nathaniel Hawthornes Scarlet Letter for my Advanced English 11 class This is not a book I would normally have picked up and read but I am glad that I read itThe Scarlet Letter deals with themes of love societys oppression secrets a character finding herself as well as numerous other classic literature themes I found the book itself to be challenging to read but I liked the story Hawthorne explores when feelings and passion conflict with religion which was fascinating to consider from a religious perspectiveAlthough I did not enjoy the book much at the time I had to read it it proved to be quite useful when I took the AP Literature and Composition Test this year When I had to choose one book to frantically review the day before the test this is the book I chose Sure enough this is the book I used for the AP test as a referenceThis is an essential book for anyone taking AP Literature"
"2","Timeless ClassicI enjoyed this book a lot once I got past the slow parts Hester Prynne is found pregnant out of wedlock Since she wont reveal the identity of the father she is forced to wear the Scarlet Letter A on her chest for the rest of her life She gives birth to a girl and she changes her life around so at the end of the book people refer to her as Angel instead of AdultererThis is a timeless tale because the situation could easily happen in any time period When we do something wrong the way we live our lives afterwards is the determining factor of our moral character One event does not define us Its our entire lives that should be taken into account I think that is Nathaniel Hawthornes point Redemption is possible for anyone regardless of their sin Also the father who remained unknown to the society but not the reader suffers enormously because he doesnt confess This is a good point When we hide our sins the only person it ultimately hurts is us"
"2","One of the Greatest Books Ever WrittenThe Scarlet Letter is an excellent book Hawthorne spends so much time discussing the characters thoughts and motives that by the end of the book you can understand why the people act the way they do It makes them seem almost real He relates nature to what the characters are experiencing that makes the story even more powerful In one place he told of a rose bush that grew by the prison so it seemed Nature was saying that even though other people had abandoned them someone could always count on the natures love Its very beautifully written The story of adultery and jealous spouses happens in our own day which makes The Scarlet Letter relate to the reader Its just a great book all over and I feel that its one of the best ever written"
"1","Does not have true plumeria scentI used to live in Hawaii Plumerias were abundant both growing and leis I was excited to have that scent again in a lotion The lotion itself is your average body lotion consistency However there is NO way that this is a true plumeria scent I would not order their other Plumeria products which are more expensivebased on this lotion"
"2","Just as describedThis bench was easy to assemble but I would suggest that you have someone else help you to hold the parts while you screw them together Otherwise it might be too difficult not in design but just in holding the large pieces in the right place I put the bench on my front patio which is uncovered It doesnt usually snow in Seattle but it did this year and the bench remained uneffected The bench has also with stood the Seattle rains This bench is as stated element proof Great for summer yard lounging as well I have been 100 satisfied"
"2","The ultimate for womenMy wife has several workout books but as she states not one matches Arnolds This book not only covers subjects like what to eat it also goes into great detail on what workouts work what muscles Great book"
"1","BoringI love Arnold and what he has accomplished so it suprised me to suggest that women should start out using 3 lb weights Sorry you wont get results like that This book my be good for seniors or those with limited physical ability"
"2","Dual Language Selections from Don QuixoteI have found that this is an excellent tool for vocabulary building I am able to understand the meaning immediatly and hope to continue buying dual language books for this reason"
"2","Best one in Tomato TrilogyReturn of the Killer Tomatoes is hilarious Anthony Starke is great J Stephen Rock Peace is back as Lt Wilbur Finletter This is the best movie in the Killer Tomato Triolgy"
"2","Pretty Fricken SweetYou know the movies and if youre looking at this page you probably love them The bottom line is you get 6 classic campy DVDs in their own cases for a good price Some of these DVDs are hard to find on their own I personally had been looking for Return to Horror High for quite some time before I decided to get this set Its well worth the money you wont be disappointed"
"2","FT rulesTalk about a hokey plot and cheezy acting this movie is GREAT The 1980s will never be forgotten as a decade of some really sad movies My God does George Clooney look young and with that mop of hair Cant wait to see The Killer Tomatoes take France"
"2","100 times better than the firstThis is the best movie since Monsturds no wait this movie is better than Monsturds even You will not find a much better than this film The first film wasnt even close to as good as this 5 stars way up for an excellent come back"
"1","Too StupidI bought this for my grandson who loves cheesy movies but even he said this movie was too stupid The first Killer Tomatoes movie at least had some funny parts This movie doesnt Dont waste your money"
"1","DECEPTIONWarning the two songs listed as Little Steve were written by him but are not the originals nor performed by him"
"1","Warning You are not downloading Little StevenI tried to download Forever by Little Steven the Disciples of Soul and through a very deceptive listing accidentally downloaded this very substandard cover version Its not the 99 cents that was stolen from me that I am worried about Its a local bar band cheating people by listing the original artist as the performer when they know perfectly well theyve never been in a studio with Little Steven"
"2","Warming Dishs Sooooo HelpfulThe Sassy Baby warming dishes are great Add the hot water let it sit while you get baby ready to eat and away you go Also keeps the food warm while baby is eating The bright colors also hold the babys attention We bought two one for home and one for grandmas houseSassy Baby Warming Dish Colors May Vary"
"1","Not what we expectedThe suction on this dish does not really work The only thing I could get it to suction to was glass we never really wanted it for the warming part just for the suction All in in all we were not very satisfied with this purchase"
"1","Not user friendlyThe dish is not easy to take apart for cleaning and I wish I could put in it the microwave"
"1","Not worth itWe tried this dish a couple of times It didnt warm the foods that much more than just putting warm food on a plate feeding it to your hungry baby Just another unnecessary step in the feeding progress Dont waste your time"
"2","Great warming dishI love this dish I try to keep from microwaving my babys food so I put really hot water in the base of this bowl It warms my babys food even food from the fridge and keeps it warm As another reviewer said the dish is very difficult to separate"
"1","NOT USER FREINDLYThis product is a good idea however1 The fill hole is not large enough to fill the bottom of the dishwith hot tap water without getting water into the serving tray2 Cant be put in the Micro3 Extremely hard to open bottom compartment to clean4 Extremely hard to open and close I and my daughter have to use abutter knife to pry open5 Not good for a grandmothers hands that has joint problems6 Doesnt keep food warm for very longPerhaps going back to the drawing board would help this product"
"1","DisappointedMaybe in time I will figure this plate out but I cannot get the suction to work and there were no directions with it as to how to take it apart use the suction clean it out It may seem simple but a harried mother needs these details I am disappointed as it is utterly useless to me at least as far as being a stayput dish which is why I purchased it"
"1","Not User Friendly NOTHING that says its BPAfreeNearly impossible to disassemble for cleaningHole for water is tinyBottom gets very hot to handle food takes awhile to warm up then remains warm for only about 20 minutesMOST importantly IS THIS DISH BPAFREE OR NOT Ive seen it listed on BPAfree lists on the web BUT there is nothing on the package or product description that deems it so"
"2","Sassy Baby Warming Dish vs Gerber BowlKeeps food warm Sticks to the tray of the high chair Gerber bowl doesnt stick The little dividers are nice for serving The only complaint is that it is very difficult to get the divided bowl off the bottom"
"2","just what i was looking fori do not use these for warming the food i did try that once and it was just a pain i purchased the bowls because they are divided and stick to the high chair so they are great for that but i would not recommend getting it if you are just looking for a warming dish"
"2","MustHave for Childrens LibraryI ordered this book as part of a third grade curriculum for my son These Everyman titles are really wonderful beautiful binding heavy pages amazing illustrations I was not disappointed with this book It is the kind of book we will read again and again and hopefully pass on to the next generation Hawthornes rendition of the myths and fables is classic and engaging and Rackhams illustrations are worth the price on their own"
"2","Very informativeI just returned from a monthlong trip to Vietnam and Cambodia and I found this book extremely useful for Cambodia Not so much for hotel listings etc but for nononsense background information on Angkor Phnomh Penh and Siem Reap The Vietnam portion was helpful as well but I relied more on the Lonely Planet and Rough Guide Vietnam editions for that country I would definitely recommend this book to someone traveling to Cambodia over the Lonely Planet edition which is really outdated"
"1","I purchased this book and attempted to use it as a resource for a trip to Cambodia in July 1999 The only current information in the entire country section was that Pol Pot has died Cambodia is a fascinating place to visitToo much has changed for this book to be of any use"
"1","1996 edition of book is outdatedThe book WAS good in its time but EVERYTHING related to traveling in this area of SE Asia especially Laos has changed drastically in the past three years Frankly a 1996 edition should be sold as remainders at about 2 then someone who wanted only info about the people or the temples could get ethnographic info only I was in Laos this past August 1998 and most published info except the Internet updates by an Australian in Nong KhaiThailand who does visas to Laos was wrong and very outdatedespecially the most important things like availability of visas and safety of busroad travel Real traveling info from books like this that are so old could be very misleading"
"1","DisappointingThis book is getting mixed reviews It seems like friends of the author say its great Those who tried to actually use the book are disappointed that everything is so out of date This edition was not updated since the first edition and is now really out of date Things change but sloppy research is always out of style"
"1","Arrived brokenWell this is one of those you get what you pay for kind of reviews Didnt pay much didnt expect much but basically functional wouldve been nice The generator came broken probably a miswire internally Yep I checked the outs with a meter and if I finagled the probe inside and touched the right spot I got voltage Just not externally Too much trouble to return it and convinced my 10year old to go with a real light powered by batteries"
"1","complicatedI still havent figured out how to put this light together When I do the wires appear very delicate and I doubt it will even work The directions are atrocious But at least it doesnt require batteries so you can feel good about not destroying the environment too much"
"1","junkthis thing is nothing but s piece of junk it came brokedidntwork i wouldnt of rated it but i had toDO NOT BUY THIS ITEAMit is nothing but a piece of junk"
"2","entertaining but not for everybodyAlthough in a certain sense I did not like this movie one thing that I did find that I did like was that it was entertaining Its a daring movie that take a rare look at what weve been missing in todays corperate hectic kiss butt culture And that is emotional honesty Its like a release a drug or even bad music that we enjoy because it allows us to express ourselves for who we know what we are to be what we are and not necessarily how we act in everyday life We definately need more movies like this despite what some critics may say"
"1","Adam Sandler lame as everI was told that this was a decent movieBut I didnt care for it I find Adam Sandler as funny as Jerry Lewis not veryThe animation was pretty good however"
"1","One of the worst I have ever seenDo not buy or rent this Adam Sandler is officially a no talent hack This is not for children or anyone for that matter unless lame brained scattological humor with absolutely no point is your thing"
"1","NauseatingIf you are adamant to watch this movie despite all the negative reviews please do it after the Holliday season This is the most depressing sad pathetic sarcastic and cruel movie that Ive ever seen in my lifeThrough all the movie I felt that I am going to cry and was depressed for the rest of the day Basically it is a movie about a guy that lost his parents during his childhood twins with serious genetic disorders and a single mom How somebody could find it funny is beyond meIf you want to kill the Holiday spirit and get into a deep depression than this movie is perfect for you If not skip it"
"1","Spare yourselfThis movie is such a bizarre combination of morality and immorality it seems like no one would really like it but there are always exceptionsIf youre looking for a sweet Christmas tale watch A Christmas Carol or The Grinch If youre looking for potty humor watch Beavis and Butthead This movie tries to be both and in the end the sick humor and complete meanness just cancel out the moral message the plot tries to portray leaving the viewer with nothing Anyone who has the impression from these reviews that this is a moral movie please beware it is far far from it There were glimmers of morality and good humor in there but they were all but eclipsed by the nastiness"
"1","Adam Sandlers eight crazy nightsI thought this was a big dissapointment It is crude beyond good taste I wish I could return the DVD but I dont have my receipt so Ill just trash it"
"1","A very disappointing movieIts sad that a animation that is clearly made to attract children was made with such rude humor and disrespect towards others How this animation could be recomended for anyone is beyond me Shame on you Adam Sandler that your ability is not used for more postive purposes"
"1","8 Crazy NightsDO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY One reviewer states the funniest Christmas movie ever This could not be farther from the truth I like many of A Sandlers movies However this movie sucked really bad It was crude and not funny reindeer pooping and eating poopcome on It was irritating and not funny the old mans voice was so grating it made you want to scream five minutes into the movie Most of all the movie was boring and embarrassing to watch in mixed company I still cant believe I wasted 400 to rent it"
"1","Clean it upThe Story is appropriate and some parts are really funny but some of it is horrible sickest humor hes done in any of his movies that Ive seen Definately not for kids I expected better after Mr Deeds Adam Sandler is really talented and there is no reason he has to produce such trash I love the Chanukah Song Im not a Jew but it makes me want to celebrate ChanukahThere are only two real redeeming features of the movie These are the little old man Whitey because he loves everyone in his actions even though they treat him like and Stones repentence for lack of a better word at the end"
"1","1 star since theres no zero stars availableI cant believe the reviewer who turned this off after the first 30 minutes How in the world did anyone watch this for 30 minutes So I only watched 10 minutes but a movie that starts the way this one does is not getting any more of my time My hairdresser highly recommended this and all I have to say to her is dont give up your day job to become a movie critic Total garbage"
"1","Eight Crazy NightsI couldnt tell you how this movie ends we turned it off after the first halfhour Not appropriate for children not entertaing for adults Our dog even left the room Dont waste your money"
"1","Parents Dont Let Your Kids Watch This MovieSomeone I know bought this in a discount rack thinking it was what it pretends to be a childrens holiday cartoon Nothing could be further from the truth I could not believe what a disgusting piece of filth it is full of perverted sexual innuendo Movies like this should not be marketed toward children and no matter what the rating that is who they were trying to target by making it look like a childrens holiday cartoon It should be kept in the back room of video stores with the restriction that only adults could see it and then only if they have absolutely no taste nor moral fortitude whatsoever I cant give this as strongly negative a review as it deserves I only gave it one star because they wouldnt let me give it none"
"2","sandler is da bomb8 crazy nights was a movie that was touching and hilarious Adam Sandler was good and should be seen by families"
"1","The thrid in a string of flops for SandlerEight Crazy Nights is the thrid back to back unfunny moviefollowing Little Nicky and Mr Deeds that Adam Sandler has made in the past two years Eight Crazy Nights is full of toiler humor and unfunny oneliners I may have laughed once or twice if these movie They should have called Eight Crazy Ways to ruin a comics carrer"
"1","i want my money backMost likely one of the worst movies i have ever seen I went to see this movie with about 5 or 6 friends when it was over we all wanted our money back The movie is not funny at all Believe me i love adam sandler but this isnt even a comedy there are alot of sad parts in it but they label it as a comedy All this movie actually is happens to be is a fairy tale for little kids huge waste of money If you want to see a real adam sandler comedy wait for anger management or rent happy gilmore"
"1","terrible movieI used to be a fan of The Simpsons but now much more of a South Park kinda guy so its near impossible to offend me really The humor was good in some spots but overall I fould it to be annoying and pointless The emotion and general plot was pretty good and Ive always liked Sandler for his singing abilities and SNL work but this movie was bad some of the singing was okay but personally I didnt like half of it Most of the content is incredibly gross and could make you vomit if eating but thats Sandlers great gold"
"1","Not a Good Hanukkah or Christams MovieThis movie was terribleWARNING SPOLIERS MAY BE POSSIBLEWell it starts out with Davey a drunk who is crude and mean Then when he gets into trouble hes doomed to community service with the town migiet Whitney No offence to little people out there that it not my intention to offend anyone Whitney sounds like Woody Allen on crack and his fernal twin sister Elenaor isnt any betterWell Davey does all he can to offend Whitney That is until his place burns up So he moves in with Whitney and his sister and they set some ground rules Then as the movie goes on they make a big deal about Davey having little emotion and when he cries its all the sudden a big deal And for some reason the deer in the woods talk and help Whitney out What or who is Whitney supposted to be Santa ClausI hate the music in it the voices are annoying and the characters are mostly unlikable So warning to parents keep your children locked up from this totally bad movie"
"1","The worst movie ever madeYeah it sounds like a cheery holiday movie for the kids but it isntIts meanspirited movie that goes nowhere Its crude and rude as you would expect from Sandler but not even in a funny way Imagine Sandler pushing a little old man in a portapotty down a hill so that he becomes a frozen shtsiclethen imagine reindeer coming to lick it off him and getting sht stuck in their teeth Yup that was in there and was about the extent of the humor thereinPlease dont buy this And if you do BE SURE to watch this before giving it as a gift or letting your children watch it"
"1","ive seen this beforethis is the worst comedy evericould tell this was an adam sandler movie right from the startit its a compilation of all the weak jokes from his past movies and albums actors and songs put together to make a very dissapointing comedy Had i known this movie was so bad i hoped someone would have brought it TO MY ATTENTION YESTERDAY"
"1","ughThe packaging was coming off the back of the package and the box it was in was distorted I wanted to give this as a christmas present but it doesnt even look new"
"2","AwesomeI have been a huge Adam Sandler fan for years I love this movie it makes me laugh so hard I would recommend it to anyone who wants a change from the same old same old holiday movies Two thumbs up"
"2","HilariousI loved this movie It was hilarious and Sandlers fans especially will be cracking themselves up I must admit that it is very crude at parts so although the cover looks appealing for youngsters it probably isnt suitable for the young ones Although I must admit that a lot of the jokes will go right over their headsThe message is good and the overall story has a message I cried for Whitey and I think any movie that moves a person to the point of crying is worth a watch But it is HILARIOUS from the triple breasted lady to Whitey and his sister to the deer whos significance I really didnt understandA must see for anyone over 13 with a good but stupid sense of humour and a desire for a couple of laughs"
"2","Adam Sandler is AwesomeThis movie is great but having it on 2 disc special edition maked it even better The special features are the shiznit"
"2","Crazy about 8 Crazy NightsThis movie is awesome It is the perfect movie for the holiday season I am absolutely crazy about Whitey the old man referee in the movie Elenore and Davey are also hilarious I love this movie and watch it over and over again with my whole family Something you should buy because it is greatSmell you later poopsicles A funny line from the best movie in the WORLD"
"1","Childrens Humor Not Suitable For ChildrenI want to say first that I am an Adam Sandler fan I loved him on SNL I have enjoyed him in everything from Billy Madison to PunchDrunk Love So with that in mind I had high hopes for Eight Crazy Nights To say it was a let down would be an understatement This is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memoryThe only thing remotely close funny is the old man named Whitey He has a few lines that might warrant a slight chuckle Sandlers Davey Stone character is so annoying you will probably be tempted to turn off the movie within the first 10 minutes If you dont youll be treated to jokes about hairy butts a woman with three breasts a man eating a jock strap and deer licking frozen feces Sounds appealing doesnt itI am sure some diehard Sandler fans think this is funny but I dont Hopefully his first animated movie will be his last"
"1","Nightmare Before HannukahI love Adam Sandler Well I used to love him before he made Eight Crazy Nights Not only was this cartoon not funny it was downright trash I would not recommend this feature to anyone Eight Crazy Nights was short on story long on time and wearing on patience I kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself I needed some justification for wasting the 2 hours of my life that I will never get back Needless to say I stuck it out until the credits and now I have to live with the facts that I 1 watched the movie and 2 Ill never get that time back So now I sit here typing away a review I doubt anyone will read wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie HUMBUG Watch Ishtar youll get more out of it Oh and I only awarded one star because Amazon insists you give everything at least one star I did this under protest"
"1","Okay There is a movie worse than StargateLet me start out by saying that I enjoy Adam Sandler movies I like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore Sure theyre not great films but theyve given me plenty of laughs So when I tell you that this is one of the most dreadful movies Ive ever watched youll know it isnt because of some bias against Mr SandlerThis may be the worst movie ever made It is cloying stupid unfunny weird and patheticin a bad way I could go on about the awful story the grating voices the cliches and schmaltz or the bad songs Yes Virginia this is a musical The worst musical ever unleashed on film No I havent seen every musical but you dont need to in order to fully understand the depths to which this film sinksDont see it Dont buy it Dont rent it Dont send any signal that they should make more crp like this"
"1","Worse Movie Ive Seen In AgesI gave this 1 star because they wouldnt let me have 0 stars The movie is just plain horrible The 12 year olds in the audience enjoyed the juvenile flatulence and other bodily function humor But this was the same audience that was passing gas in the theater and laughing at themselves It will be a long time before I waste money on another Adam Sandler film"
"1","To be honestTo be 100 honest i thought the movie was boring and too sappy for a cartoonThe old guy got on my nerves and the movie was just so unlike adamI mean come on we all know he could have done way better than this stupid movieIm sorry but i just think the movie was horrible"
"1","SucksYeah well this movie was just terrible Sandler tries paroding the classic cartoon musical but he fails in every way possible I mean this is a stupid movie one song is about how great the mall is and then another song has the logos of different stores singing to him Its almost a marketing ploy to get people to go holiday shopping more The film also tries to make the audience sympathize with Sandlers character but once again it fails we have seen the Grinch and A Christmas Carol too many times to actually care about this Jewish Scrooge This movie sucks all around with cheap gross out humor that may have worked better had it been live action but that would have defeated the purpose of the film And one last comment Why the hell is this a double disc DVD All of Sandlers good andor funny movies are singular yet this movie is terribe and it gets the extra feature treatment This movie sucks"
"2","return to forever prototypeThree musicians out of five on this effort formed Return to Forever so you can imagine a strong resemblance to the ECM first album I always loved Corea with Farrell because of the pulsing sound Chick adds behind Joes flutes sax etc like rain drops or storming Nice soprano And ELVIN JONES I put this up up around the Joe Farrell Quartet album and Buster Williams bass is great so much I dont miss Mclaughlin or Dave Holland A fresh sound unparreled even now It makes me want to see the Outback movie The album cover is beautiful Finally the price is outstanding Before Joe tried funky disco sounds and lost his way"
"1","Inappropriate for young childrenIn two of the episodes the word shut up is used My son is three years old and instantly picked up on it repeated it and told me it was a bad word but that James and Duck the trains had said it I would stay away from this one especially if you have young impressionable youngsters I gave it one star since the wooden dragon train came with it"

"1","IllegibleIt was an illegible photocopy It appeared as if someone took a picture of every page of an original Principles of Science then faxed those pictures to the printer in order to produce this bookI returned it immediately"
"2","The only boots my husband will wearThese boots are very well made my husband wears them for work and he loves them They hold up well even with every day wear got a year out of the last pair he also says they are very comfortable"
"1","Why so expensiveWhy does this series need to be so much more expensive than most of the other TV shows Especially considering these dont even have the original soundtrack The first thing I think of when I think about My Three Sons is the great music that went along with the show and its missing from this way overpriced version As much as I love My Three Sons I will wait for the original version to be released at a reasonable price before I buy"
"1","Spun OutThe best things about this heavily formula vehicle are 1 Elvis opening production numbers including a nicely staged Adam And Evil 2 Deborah Walleys girl drummer role 3 the Deusenberg and 4 Elvis closing production number the medium walking blues Ill Be Back Everything else is redundant"
"1","The Road To Love Is Full Of Danger SignsThree lovely young ladies all want Elvis gearstick in this craptastic musical comedy thats so bad it ROCKS I just love the title song sequence where Les and the guys provide Elvis with lots and lots of girls And who was that chick the blonde with the short cropped hair who literally shoves all the other chikadees aside to get up and spinout with the King She looks like shes out to prove she can really score and I never saw parts move like that before Elvis looks embarrassed Anyway after youve crossed those double lines and Spinout you will want to do so again and again and again Simply awful but I mean that in a great way"
"2","Who else would have three beautiful women after himSpinout has Elvis playing a singing race car driver with three beautiful women who want to race him down the aisle to marriage They are Shelley Fabares Diane McBain and Deborah Walley Looks like Elvis has a tough decision I cant decide myself In Spinout youll find two veteran stars in the height of their stardom Cecil Kellaway and Una Merkel in one of her last roles Also the man who plays Shelley Fabares father is Carl Betz who also starred with her as her father on The Donna Reed Show So try to not to knock this movie Its got great songs and the title tune was a top 40 hit by just that much So treat yourself to a swinging film that you just cant understand why Elvis wants to stay single"
"1","Presleys Worst FilmSpinout 1966 represents the nadir of Elvis Cinema a bad sitcom without the laugh track The only redeeming features are a few memorable songs such as Ill Be Back and Stop Look and Listen Buy the soundtrack and skip the movie"
"1","The musics better than the movieSPINOUT is another hard movie to sit through thanks to the weak dialogue and even weaker storylineElvis plays a singing race car driver for the second time who is being chased by three women These include a spoiled brat Shelley Fabares an erotic author Diane McBain and his own drummer Deborah WalleyThe music is actually listenable in this picture Highlights include Stop Look and Listen and Ill Be BackElvis appears to be sleepwalking through this one His appearance is also disturbing slightly overweight and his hair looks like a big black ball on his headAgain not QUITE the worst but far from the best Buy something more worthwhile first"
"1","NOT A GOOD SPIN FOR PRESLEYThis is not Presleys best vehicle but by this outing he was not being allowed to act anyway so he appears to be just going though the motions The movie songs are not a real treat either he seems to be singing to everyone including his enemies Where does the music come from when he sings anyway When asked to do this movie Presley should have JUST SAID NO"
"2","SpinoutMy husband and I love auto racing of all kinds My husband loved this movie Im writing this review for him as Im not much of an Elvis Presley fan"
"1","Piece of junkThis would be a nifty little contraption if it wasnt for the fact that you cant change the top my primary impetus for buying itI have a Handspring Visor and lost my stylus I didnt want to pay for shipping on a new stylus 3pack from Handspring so I went to Best Buy and purchased this instead Not only can you not change the top so that it fits in the Visor properly but now the entire headpiece falls out constantly so that the bottom part of the stylus gets stuck in the stylusholder Oh and did I mention that the light function only works part of the timeNot worth your time or effort"
"2","Works and is easy to useYou drop a fixed number of drops into a fixed amount of water as measured in the enclosed test tube up to the given line The number of drops to use is listed right on the bottle After a few minutes you compare the color of the water to the color chart on a card which gives you your nitrite level Its plenty easy and effectiveIt could be even easier if the chart was on the bottle no need for that extra card lying around or if there was a test where you just stuck a gauge in some water and got the value but Ive never seen anything like that that doesnt expire at some point"
"2","Great BuyThis item arrived well packed and undamaged It looks exactly like the picture was fairly easy to assemble and is sturdy and well made Of course it is an assembly required piece of furniture but once put together it looks like a really nice quality piece My daughter loves it It is sized for a child and is too small for an adult I think shell be able to use it through age 11 or 12 It also has a convenient hole in the back of the hutch for her computer wire to poke through I looked at this item EVERYWHERE including eBay and Amazon was the cheapest of all The chair comes included so dont buy an extra chair separately"
"2","Great DeskThis is the best kids desk you will find for the money I can almost guarantee that It comes well packaged and requires very little assembly The wood is solid not the cheap particle board you find in most big box stores"
"2","good quality for priceThis desk is really pretty It is a good size but not overly big in the room I learned from other reviews that the chair is included with this desk purchase and not to order the chair separately I also ordered the matching 3shelf bookcase which is a slightly different shade of white but nothing too noticeableespecially since they arent by each other We rubbed beeswax on the bottom of the drawer so it slides more easily I would recommend this to anyone who doesnt want to spend a fortune but still wants something that looks nice"
"2","Great desk and a great buy Thanks AmazonWe bought this desk for my seven year old daughter to keep her lap top on and to do homework It was not to disappoint The desk is perfect size for her to sit and work Very high quality and easy to put together I would highly recommend this product to others"
"2","Love KidKraftI love this desk In fact I have two One for my daughter and one for my son They are beautiful flawless and go together easily They are sturdy and should last a many years So happy with this purchase"
"2","Great Value for Less MoneyI searched hi and low for a desk that would work in my sons small room I wanted a desk made of wood and available in honey finish to match his other furniture with a small hutch as a large hutch wouldnt workand at a reasonable price The Kidcraft Avalon Desk is perfect I took off one star because I didnt realize how short it was ok for my 9 yr old son now but as he grows up Im afraid he will outgrow the desk It would be great if Kidcraft offered taller replacement legs so that the desk could be raised higher as your child grows I feel the desk is sturdy enough to go off with my child to college if were not for the short height Dear Kidcraftplease make taller replacement legs so that the desk can be normal desk height for later years making is a Teenkraft desk Thanks"
"2","very niceThis desk is definitely worth the money My daughter wanted a white desk with a hutch and had picked out many over not including the chair I ordered this one without her knowing and at first she was upset because the hutch is not that big But once it was assembled she loves it She is 8 and loves the little cubbies in the hutch Everything is packaged nicely and there was not one scratch or ding or funny smells The hardware had everything you needed no extras in separate baggies for the chair and desk I put it together myself in about 1 hour We did replace the knob with a blue glass knob from the hardware store just to make it a little more unique I guess and it looks great With free supersaver shipping and no sales tax there is no better buy out there Trust me I have looked"
"2","Very SatisfiedI was very pleased with this desk and chair Was able to assemble it fairly easy and now my daughter is enjoying it very much The desk is quite sturdy and the chair is strong The delivery of my product was expedited quickly Thank you very much"
"2","Great value for good quality productLove this desk and chair set Bought it for my KGer who is enjoying using it for his arts and crafts projects as well as for homework It is good quality took less than an hour to put together and definitely sturdy material this coming from a mom of a very rambunctious 5yr old The only thing is that I can see my kid growing out of it in 2 or 3 yrs Its not very high and the chair is small so is more catered to younger kids i would say probably 8yrs and younger"
"2","If its good enough for PopeyeI always keeps a can of this fine product on me person You never knows when some palooka wot aint on the up and square is gonna need to be put in his place It always leaves ya strong to the finish"
"2","A Must Have for ALL Aspects of Love DevoteesBeing a huge Aspects of Love fan I was extremely excited to find another cast recording I was sceptical however after reading reviews for this recording After listening to it all of my fears were put aside This is a wonderful recording that possesses both brisk conducting and deep emotion from its musical director I felt that the cast was extremely dramatic and that the piece was very well sung Having listened to several other ALW cast recordings I feel that this cast was excellent A must have for all Aspects of Love devotees"
"1","Cheap and dangerousThough Ive had this only about a month it is starting to go It puts shards of sharp plastic in the food From searching the net on this I find that my experience is not unique eitherDo NOT buyOther better brands include Unicorn recommended by a famous cooking magazine Peugeot Firth and William Bounds"
"1","Skip it buy the full sized versionThis one makes too small and too fine a grind of pepper to be useful in cooking Youll be cranking away on this thing for ten minutes before you get enough crushed pepper to flavor anything"
"1","SlowI bought this grinder because it could be operated with one hand However I was very disappointed in the volume of pepper it puts out per squeeze If you are looking for a good wrist strength training exerciser this is your grinder"
"1","Multilevel marketing meets educationI had to purchase this book for a community college class Im taking As a textbook it has been a complete disappointment The science is sketchy the research is shoddy and the huge holes in logic are brushed over with explanations like you cant prove nearly anything empirically in education straight from page 8 Some of the concepts presented are interesting but since Mr Jensen no he doesnt hold a doctorate provides almost no citations for his claims there is no way to check his assertions or determine where the theories come from The book reads like a multilevel marketing sales pitch In fact you are encouraged to share it with your friends and colleagues and are directed to a website where you could empty your bank account getting certified in Mr Jensens unique empirically unproven techniques"
"2","WellResearched easy to read practicalMr Jensen has saved me and other teachers the time of gathering together the latest information about the brain learning and so much more He has made all this scholarly research accessible and fun to read I wish the deadwood at my school would at least read this book but I hope they would also use the great ideas in it too for the students sake"
"1","Pop psychology at its worseMr Jensen and his wife have developed a veritable cottage industry replete with workshops seminars presentations publications certifications if youve got the money then they have something to sell youand all of it is centered around what is termed brainbased learningbut what this book presents is little more than 400 pages of scientifically unsubstantiated claims and recommendationsfor example it claims that the color yellow somehow enhances intellectual performance and hence classrooms should be painted yellowhowever he doesnt offer a shred of evidence to back that claim upits all just ridiculoushow does this stuff ever make it into print"
"2","Get off the dead horse of old school educationTo those seeking an outline of what education needs to practice so no child is left behind this book is a starting point about how people learn The flow of the book is easy to follow and considers the research findings of how the brain learns in stages of life Unlike those who consider brain research a fad I know from application of the knowledge in this book the influential changes do produce positive results for students In the world of accountability the tools of Brain Based teaching will allow students and teachers a solution in leveling the field for the students from less fortunate environments which politicians are clueless about in regards the obstacles of survivalists of poverty I highly reccommend this book to those wishing to get off the dead horse and provide a productive environment for education in the 21st century"
"2","Easy read for brain informationThis book was purchased for a PhD level course It is a very easy read It gives practical applications to the latest brain research On a down note there are not a lot of references documented within the text when Jensen quotes a study but he does give an extensive bibliography This book can be used for parents to read about how their childs brain works or for teachers within a school system It is a good book to read if you want basic information about the brain from an education standpoint"
"1","Fuzzy around the edgesI have only read the first 44 pages of this book so Id need to read the rest So far though it is interesting but seems fuzzy The writer makes a lot of claims but I was rarely sure if they were proven or just speculation This is the kind of sentence that makes me queasyGiven all the activations happening at once in the brain physical performance probably uses 100 precent of the brain p 39Probably Why Does any one activity use 100 percent of the brain And if physical performance does why is that important"
"1","Brain Based Learning The New Paradigm of TeachingI am currently reading the Kindle version of this book The book itself is very easy to read and full of material to try in the class room Unfortunately there are no page numbers that correspond to the paper version of the book As this is a text book it is impossible to cite material and the page from which it was taken This is really unacceptable for a text book It is one thing if it were a literature book and even then it would be better to have the physical page number of the actual book If I had known that there were no page numbers contained in this Kindle version I would NOT have purchased it I would have purchased a used hard copy"
"2","Brain based LearningThis is a text book I ordered for my classes for teacher certification This book is very easy to read and I am really enjoying it It presents info and then at the end of a section recaptures the essence of the reading for you I would suggest it for any teaching class I am learning so much from this book I have been buying all my text books from Amazon because they are so much cheaper and sometimes I can get free shipping So far there has not been a book that I could not find here at Amazon"
"1","Pop psychology at its worstI find it hard to believe people fall for this stuff He writes so much stuff that he pulls out of midair supposedly based on the brain research If you are unfortunate enough to take a class that requires this read it carefully He jumps to conclusions with little to no evidence to back it up Plus he is neither a teacher nor a neurologist He just found something he can write about and sound like an expert Plus the writing seems written for well lets say young readers Very simplistic which is not always bad but in this case it isAgain read carefully Analyze his statements and look for the actual scientific proof for them You will be hardpressed to find any either in his book or elsewhere Total fluff"
"1","ScienceOn average we breathe through one nostril for about three hours until the tissue becomes slightly engorged then we switch to the other side The nostril we breathe through affects which brain hemisphere we use p25The female brain processes both language and feeling at the same time far more efficiently than the male brain does p20These two quotes should tell you what you need to know about the quality of the science contained in this bookLord if this is what we teach our teachers"
