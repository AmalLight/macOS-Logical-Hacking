se pdf y = x/2
   cdf % = int( 1/2 * x ) = 1/2 * int( x ) = 1/2 * x^2/2 = x^2/4

| What is the 50th percentile of the CDF F(x)=(x^2)/4 from the example above?

cdf x = 0.5 # con una proporzione sulla base ? devo avere il 50%
x^2/4 = 0.5
  x^2 = 0.5*4
    x = sqrt( 2 )
    x = 1.41

cdf 0.5 = 0.06 # con una proporzione del 50% sulla base, quanta probabilità ho ? %

1.41 ? è il 70.5 di 2
cdf per 0.705 = 0.124
