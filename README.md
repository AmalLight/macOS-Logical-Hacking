Look near . <br />
Lost the right path , <br />
a new gate , <br />
will be open . <br />

So, this gate will be closed for anyone other , <br />
because only one can find it open , <br />
in one specific time . <br />

It's necessary to be ready every day of life , <br />
to catch that . <br />

Close to each , without run , <br />
the doors remaining open for someone else . <br />

Move fast , <br />
remove them , <br />
think this like more fun . <br />

If to be good means follow these rules , <br />
not everyone can be samurai . <br />

The difference between to be and do better , <br />
anywhere will give us more power . <br />
